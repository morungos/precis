"24836053","Icotinib is an active treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer: a retrospective study.","BACKGROUND: Icotinib hydrochloride is a novel epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with preclinical and clinical activity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This retrospective analysis was performed to assess the efficacy of icotinib on patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: 82 consecutive patients treated with icotinib as first (n = 24) or second/third line (n = 58) treatment at three hospitals in Nanjing were enrolled into our retrospective research. The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) was used to evaluate the tumor responses and the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Median PFS was 4.0 months (95% CI 2.311-5.689). Median OS was 11.0 months (95% CI 8.537-13.463) in this cohort. Median PFS for first and second/third line were 7.0 months (95% CI 2.151-11.8) and 3.0 months (95% CI 1.042-4.958), respectively. Median OS for first and second/third line were 13.0 months (95% CI 10.305-15.695) and 10.0 months (95% CI 7.295-12.70), respectively. In patients with EGFR mutation (n = 19), icotinib significantly reduced the risk of progression (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.18-0.70, p = 0.003) and death (HR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02-0.42, p = 0.002) compared with those EGFR status unknown (n = 63). The most common adverse events were acne-like rash (39.0%) and diarrhea (20.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Icotinib is active in the treatment of patients with NSCLC both in first or second/third line, especially in those patients harbouring EGFR mutations, with an acceptable adverse event profile.","0"
"24788118","CTNNB1 S45F Mutation Predicts Poor Efficacy of Meloxicam Treatment for Desmoid Tumors: A Pilot Study.","We hypothesized that patterns of CTNNB1 (β-catenin) mutations would affect the outcome of conservative therapy in patients with desmoid tumors. This study aimed to determine the significance of CTNNB1 (β-catenin) mutations in predicting the treatment outcome in patients with desmoid tumors treated with meloxicam, a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitor. Between 2003 and 2012, consecutive thirty-three patients with extra-peritoneal sporadic desmoid tumors were prospectively treated with meloxicam as the initial systemic medical therapy. The efficacy of meloxicam was evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). DNA was isolated from frozen tissue or formalin-fixed materials. CTNNB1 mutation analysis was performed by direct sequencing. Positivity of nuclear β-catenin staining by immunohistochemistry was compared with the status of CTNNB1 mutations. The correlation between the efficacy of meloxicam treatment and status of CTNNB1 mutations was analyzed. Of the 33 patients with meloxicam treatment, one showed complete remission (CR), 7 partial remission (PR), 12 stable disease (SD), and 13 progressive disease (PD). The following 3 point mutations were identified in 21 of the 33 cases (64%): T41A (16 cases), S45F (4 cases) and S45P (one case). The nuclear expression of β-catenin correlated significantly with CTNNB1 mutation status (p = 0.035); all four cases with S45F mutation exhibited strong nuclear expression of β-catenin. S45F mutation was significantly associated with a poor response (all cases; PD) (p = 0.017), whereas the other mutations had no impact on efficacy. The CTNNB1 mutation status was of significant prognostic value for meloxicam treatment in patients with sporadic desmoid tumors.","1"
