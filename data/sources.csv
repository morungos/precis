"Novel mutations of the MET proto-oncogene in papillary renal carcinomas.","1999","Hereditary papillary renal carcinoma (HPRC) is characterized by multiple, bilateral papillary renal carcinomas. Previously, we demonstrated missense mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET proto-oncogene in HPRC and a subset of sporadic papillary renal carcinomas. In this study, we screened a large panel of sporadic papillary renal carcinomas and various solid tumors for mutations in the MET proto-oncogene. Summarizing these and previous results, mutations of the MET proto-oncogene were detected in 17/129 sporadic papillary renal carcinomas but not in other solid tumors. We detected five novel missense mutations; three of five mutations were located in the ATP-binding region of the tyrosine kinase domain of MET. One novel mutation in MET, V1110I, was located at a codon homologous to an activating mutation in the c-erbB proto-oncogene. These mutations caused constitutive phosphorylation of MET when transfected into NIH3T3 cells. Molecular modeling studies suggest that these activating mutations interfere with the intrasteric mechanism of tyrosine kinase autoinhibition and facilitate transition to the active form of the MET kinase. The low frequency of MET mutations in noninherited papillary renal carcinomas (PRC) suggests that noninherited PRC may develop by a different mechanism than hereditary papillary renal carcinoma.","10327054","IVD","10327054","1"
"Wild-type p53 protein shows calcium-dependent binding to F-actin.","1999","Nuclear localization of p53 is required for p53 to detect and respond to DNA strand abnormalities and breaks following DNA damage. This leads to activation of the tumour suppressive functions of p53 resulting in either cell cycle arrest and DNA repair; or apoptosis. Critical functional changes in DNA which require strand breaks, including gene rearrangement, may transiently mimic DNA damage: here it is important not to trigger a p53 response. The fine control of p53 in these different circumstances is unknown but may include transient sequestering of p53 in the cytoplasm. Reversible nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling is an intrinsic property of p53 (Middeler et al., 1997) associated with cell cycle-related changes in p53's subcellular distribution. Takahashi and Suzuki (1994) described p53 inactivation by shuttling to the cytoplasm and Katsumoto et al. (1995) found wild-type p53 to be closely associated with cytoplasmic actin filaments during DNA synthesis. Here we show that, in the presence of free calcium ions, p53 binds directly to F-actin with a dissocation constant of about 10 microM. Thus, part of the regulatory machinery in normal cell cycling may involve p53-actin interactions regulated by calcium fluxes and the dynamic turnover of F-actin.","10327055","IVD","10327054","2"
"Somatic mutations of the MET oncogene are selected during metastatic spread of human HNSC carcinomas.","2000","A metastatic cancer develops by accumulation of mutations in genes that control growth, survival and spreading. The latter genes have not yet been identified. In lymph node metastases of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), we found mutations in the MET oncogene, which encodes the tyrosine kinase receptor for Scatter Factor, a cytokine that stimulates epithelial cell motility and invasiveness during embryogenesis and tissue remodeling. We identified two somatic mutations: the Y1230C, known as a MET germline mutation which predisposes to hereditary renal cell carcinoma, and the Y1235D that is novel and changes a critical tyrosine, known to regulate MET kinase activity. The mutated MET receptors are constitutively active and confer an invasive phenotype to transfected cells. Interestingly, cells carrying the MET mutations are selected during metastatic spread: transcripts of the mutant alleles are highly represented in metastases, but barely detectable in primary tumors. These data indicate that cells expressing mutant MET undergo clonal expansion during HNSCC progression and suggest that MET might be one of the long sought oncogenes controlling progression of primary cancers to metastasis.","10734314","IVD","10734314","1"
"Evidence of epigenetic changes affecting the chromatin state of the retinoic acid receptor beta2 promoter in breast cancer cells.","2000","Retinoic acid (RA)-resistance in breast cancer cells has been associated with irreversible loss of retinoic acid receptor beta, RARbeta, gene expression. Search of the causes affecting RARbeta gene activity has been oriented at identifying possible differences either at the level of one of the RARbeta promoters, RARbeta2, or at regulatory factors. We hypothesized that loss of RARbeta2 activity occurs as a result of multiple factors, including epigenetic modifications, which can pattern RARbeta2 chromatin state. Using methylation-specific PCR, we found hypermethylation at RARbeta2 in a significant proportion of both breast cancer cell lines and primary breast tumors. Treatment of cells with a methylated RARbeta2 promoter, by means of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR), led to demethylation within RARbeta2 and expression of RARbeta indicating that DNA methylation is at least one factor, contributing to RARbeta inactivity. However, identically methylated promoters can differentially respond to RA, suggesting that RARbeta2 activity may be associated to different repressive chromatin states. This supposition is supported by the finding that the more stable repressive RARbeta2 state in the RA-resistant MDA-MB-231 cell line can be alleviated by the HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), with restoration of RA-induced RARbeta transcription. Thus, chromatin-remodeling drugs might provide a strategy to restore RARbeta activity, and help to overcome the hurdle of RA-resistance in breast cancer.","10734315","IVD","10734314","2"
"Mutations of the BRAF gene in human cancer.","2002","Cancers arise owing to the accumulation of mutations in critical genes that alter normal programmes of cell proliferation, differentiation and death. As the first stage of a systematic genome-wide screen for these genes, we have prioritized for analysis signalling pathways in which at least one gene is mutated in human cancer. The RAS RAF MEK ERK MAP kinase pathway mediates cellular responses to growth signals. RAS is mutated to an oncogenic form in about 15% of human cancer. The three RAF genes code for cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases that are regulated by binding RAS. Here we report BRAF somatic missense mutations in 66% of malignant melanomas and at lower frequency in a wide range of human cancers. All mutations are within the kinase domain, with a single substitution (V599E) accounting for 80%. Mutated BRAF proteins have elevated kinase activity and are transforming in NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore, RAS function is not required for the growth of cancer cell lines with the V599E mutation. As BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase that is commonly activated by somatic point mutation in human cancer, it may provide new therapeutic opportunities in malignant melanoma.","12068308","VD","12068308","1"
"A large nucleolar U3 ribonucleoprotein required for 18S ribosomal RNA biogenesis.","2002","Although the U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), a member of the box C/D class of snoRNAs, was identified with the spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) over 30 years ago, its function and its associated protein components have remained more elusive. The U3 snoRNA is ubiquitous in eukaryotes and is required for nucleolar processing of pre-18S ribosomal RNA in all organisms where it has been tested. Biochemical and genetic analyses suggest that U3 pre-rRNA base-pairing interactions mediate endonucleolytic pre-rRNA cleavages. Here we have purified a large ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that contains the U3 snoRNA and 28 proteins. Seventeen new proteins (Utp1 17) and Rrp5 were present, as were ten known components. The Utp proteins are nucleolar and specifically associated with the U3 snoRNA. Depletion of the Utp proteins impedes production of the 18S rRNA, indicating that they are part of the active pre-rRNA processing complex. On the basis of its large size (80S; calculated relative molecular mass of at least 2,200,000) and function, this complex may correspond to the terminal knobs present at the 5' ends of nascent pre-rRNAs. We have termed this large RNP the small subunit (SSU) processome.","12068309","VD","12068308","2"
"Juxtamembrane mutant V560GKit is more sensitive to Imatinib (STI571) compared with wild-type c-kit whereas the kinase domain mutant D816VKit is resistant.","2002","Imatinib (Glivec; STI571) is an ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor of c-Abl, BCR/ABL, c-Kit, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Overexpression or constitutive activation of Kit by mutations have been associated with various malignancies. Mutations in the intracellular juxtamembrane region of Kit (e.g., V560G) are common in gastrointestinal stromal tumors and have been linked to poor prognosis. Mutations in the kinase domain of Kit (e.g., D816V) have been detected in mastocytosis, acute myeloid leukemia, and germ-cell tumors. To determine the sensitivity of Kit mutants to Imatinib in the same cellular background, wild-type Kit (WTKit), V560GKit and D816VKit were expressed in FDC-P1 cells. Growth of FDC(WTKit) was inhibited by Imatinib with GI50 (a concentration of drug at which 50% inhibition of growth occurs) of 0.1-0.2 microM but FDC(V560GKit) were more sensitive to Imatinib with a GI50 of 0.01-0.025 microM and FDC(D816VKit) were resistant to Imatinib with a GI50 greater than 5 microM. The naturally occurring isoforms of c-Kit did not differ in their sensitivity to Imatinib. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis indicated that 1 microM Imatinib reduced phosphorylation of WTKit and completely blocked phosphorylation of V560GKit but did not affect D816VKit phosphorylation. In signaling studies, addition of stem cell factor (SCF) induced phosphorylation of ERK and Akt by WTKit, and ERK, Akt and STAT3 by V560GKit, which were all blocked by Imatinib. Imatinib also blocked the constitutive activation of Akt and STAT3 by V560GKit but had no affect on the constitutive activation of ERK, Akt, and STAT3 by D816VKit. Overall, these findings demonstrate the increased susceptibility of the Kit juxtamembrane mutant, V560G, and the resistance of the kinase domain mutant, D816V, to Imatinib compared with WTKit.","12481435","VD","12481435","1"
"Inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase activity of human lymphocytes after oral administration of Oltipraz.","2002","Several preclinical studies indicated that Oltipraz appears to be one of the most potent cancer chemopreventive agents. Pharmacological studies in humans provided substantial amounts of information related to doses and schedules. Oltipraz has been reported to induce phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes. However, its chemopreventive activity suggests that it may also interact with cellular processes associated with cancer cell growth and proliferation. During a clinical trial designed to monitor eventual Oltipraz toxicity in high-risk population for development of lung cancer, we performed companion studies related to cell proliferation. Human lymphocytes were chosen as surrogate tissue to assess the in vivo effects of Oltipraz on cell signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation. The results of this study demonstrate that Oltipraz markedly inhibited the activation state of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family of kinases in lymphocytes of subjects treated with two different doses and schedules of Oltipraz. Individual variations were observed that were not related to Oltipraz dosing or schedule of administration. The results from this study indicate that lymphocytes could be used as surrogate tissue for the development of biomarkers for studies of anticarcinogenic agents.","12481436","VD","12481435","2"
"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2: evaluation of the genotype-phenotype relationship.","2003","HYPOTHESIS. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) is caused by RET proto-oncogene mutations and has a strong penetrance for medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Subtypes are defined by the presence or absence of pheochromocytomas, hyperparathyroidism, and characteristic clinical stigmas. We hypothesize that specific RET mutations correlate with the MEN 2 phenotype and aggressiveness of MTC. DESIGN. Review of endocrine surgery database from 1951 through 2002. SETTING. Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS. Eighty-six patients from 47 kindreds were identified with MEN 2A, MEN 2B, or familial MTC. Patients were classified into 3 RET mutation risk groups: level 1, low risk for MTC (codons 609, 768, 790, 791, 804, and 891); level 2, intermediate risk (codons 611, 618, 620, and 634); and level 3, highest risk (codons 883 and 918). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES. Stage of MTC at diagnosis and at last follow-up and frequency of pheochromocytomas and hyperparathyroidism. RESULTS. RET analysis was complete for 71 patients from 39 kindreds. Multivariate analysis identified an increased likelihood of stage III or IV MTC at diagnosis with increasing age (odds ratio, 1.12 per year of age at thyroidectomy; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.17; P<.001) and increasing risk group (odds ratio, 14.23 per incremental increase in MTC risk group from 1 to 3; 95% confidence interval, 3.05-66.55; P<.001). Pheochromocytomas were found in 21 patients from 12 kindreds; 20 of 21 patients had codon 634 or 918 mutations. Hyperparathyroidism was found in 10 patients from 7 kindreds; 7 of 10 patients had codon 634 mutations. CONCLUSION. Specific RET mutations predict the phenotypic expression of disease and the MTC aggressiveness in patients with MEN 2, guiding the timing of thyroidectomy and screening for pheochromocytoma.","12686527","IIC","12686527","1"
"Changes in the general surgical workload, 1991-1999.","2003","HYPOTHESIS. The volume and types of procedures performed by general surgeons have changed from 1991 to 1999. Data Source Medicare data from 1991 through 1999. METHODS. Procedures from the Medicare database were defined as ""general surgical"" if the yearly volume performed by general surgeons exceeded 1000 cases. These procedures were divided into major and minor procedures. The total volume performed by all surgeons and the volume of cases performed by general surgeons were tabulated for each procedure. Procedures were also grouped into families. For major surgery, representative procedures with the highest volumes were selected for each family. For minor surgery, multiple high-volume procedures within families were selected and analyzed. RESULTS. The volumes for each major surgical family were totaled. Although the volume of representative major general surgical procedures performed by all surgeons rose by 17 544 cases, the volume performed by general surgeons decreased by 8846 cases (1.8%). The total and general surgical volumes for cholecystectomy and appendectomy increased, but the volumes for breast surgery, hernia repair, splenectomy, and colon resection decreased. The total volume increased but the general surgical volume decreased for vascular surgery, pulmonary surgery, and major amputations. CONCLUSIONS. From 1991 to 1999, there has been a decrease in the volume of major procedures performed by general surgeons. Part of this loss relates to reduced general surgical involvement in subspecialty surgery, but there were also reductions in colon surgery, breast surgery, hernia repairs, and splenectomy. The volume of appendectomies and cholecystectomies increased. The volume of minor procedures performed by general surgeons increased slightly, with gains in vascular and endoscopic surgery.","12686528","IIC","12686527","2"
"Alterations of the c-kit gene in testicular germ cell tumors.","2003","Expression and gain-of-function mutation of the c-kit gene, that encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT), have been reported in mast cell tumors and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Among human testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs), seminomas and seminoma components of mixed GCTs have also been shown to express KIT, but only one study has found the c-kit gene mutation at exon 17 in seminoma. To elucidate the frequency and location of the c-kit gene mutation of testicular GCTs, we analyzed the whole coding region of the c-kit complementary DNA along with 4 mutational hot spots (exons 9, 11, 13 and 17) of the c-kit genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Somatic mutations were found in 4 pure seminomas of 34 testicular GCTs (11.8%). One mutation was found in exon 11 (W557R) and the others were observed in exon 17 (D816H and D816V). These types of mutations were reported in GISTs (W557R), seminoma (D816H) and mastocytosis (D816V) and were considered to be gain-of-function mutations, although there were no differences of any clinicopathological factors or outcome between patients with and without mutations. Additionally, we also demonstrated coexpression of Gly-Asn-Asn-Lys510-513 (GNNK) + and GNNK - isoforms of the c-kit gene with dominance of the GNNK - transcript in all testicular GCTs. The mutations and/or preferential expression of GNNK - isoform of the c-kit gene might play an important role in the development of testicular GCTs, and these tumors may also be targets for STI571, which is a promising drug for advanced and metastatic GISTs.","12824871","IVD","12824871","1"
"Different frequencies of Streptococcus anginosus infection in oral cancer and esophageal cancer.","2003","Multiple cancers frequently occur in the upper aerodigestive tract. The high incidence rate of multiple carcinomas in this region is often explained in terms of involvement of the same underlying risk factors. It has been reported that the oral bacterium Streptococcus anginosus (S. anginosus) is associated with esophageal, gastric, and pharyngeal cancer tissues. In this study, a highly specific quantification method for S. anginosus DNA using real-time PCR was established. We employed this assay to determine whether S. anginosus is also associated with oral cancer tissues. This precise quantification method revealed different degrees of infection with S. anginosus in esophageal cancer and oral cancer. We assayed 10 ng of genomic DNA from cancer tissues, and found that eight of 18 samples (44%) from the esophagus contained a detectable level (>10 fg) of S. anginosus DNA, whereas this was the case for only five of 38 samples (13%) of oral cancer. The quantity of S. anginosus DNA in the esophageal cancer tissues was significantly higher than in oral cancer. The maximum amount of S. anginosus DNA was approximately ten times higher in esophageal than in oral cancer tissues. In addition, none of the five different oral cancer sites (floor of the mouth, mandibular gingival, maxillary gingival, buccal mucosal, and tongue) showed significant signs of S. anginosus infection. On the other hand, most non-cancerous tissues of the esophagus and tongue showed an undetectable level of S. anginosus. These results suggest that S. anginosus is associated with esophageal cancer, but is not closely related with oral cancer.","12824872","IVD","12824871","2"
"ras mutations are associated with aggressive tumor phenotypes and poor prognosis in thyroid cancer.","2003","PURPOSE. ras oncogenic activation has long been demonstrated in thyroid carcinomas of follicular cell derivation, but no consistent relationship has been shown between mutations and clinicopathologic features. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We analyzed H-, K-, and N-ras mutations by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism followed by DNA sequencing in 125 thyroid carcinoma specimens from 107 patients, to include tumors covering the entire spectrum of thyroid tumor differentiation. RESULTS. Mutations were identified in four (8.2%) of 49 well-differentiated carcinomas (WDCs; two [6.7%] of 30 of the tumors were papillary carcinomas, two [10.5%] of 19 of them were follicular carcinomas), in 16 (55.2%) of 29 poorly differentiated carcinomas (PDCs), and in 15 (51.7%) of 29 undifferentiated carcinomas, with a significant association between ras mutation and poorly or undifferentiated tumors (P <.001). Twenty-six (74.3%) of 35 patients with ras-mutated tumors died as a result of disease as opposed to 23 (31.9%) of 72 patients with tumors lacking the mutations. Among patients with differentiated thyroid carcinomas (WDC and PDC), 11 (55.0%) of 20 patients with mutated tumors died as a result of disease as opposed to nine (15.5%) of 58 patients with wild-type ras tumors, and the correlation was independent of tumor differentiation and stage (P =.016). K-ras codon 13 mutations (all with G-A nucleotide transitions resulting in Gly>Asp substitution) and single activating mutations in any of the ras genes were also independent predictors of poor survival in differentiated thyroid carcinomas (P =.027 and P =.007, respectively). CONCLUSION. These findings demonstrate that ras mutations are a marker for aggressive cancer behavior and indicate a possible role of ras genotyping to identify thyroid carcinoma subsets associated with poor prognosis.","12947056","VD","12947056","1"
"TGFBR1*6A and cancer risk: a meta-analysis of seven case-control studies.","2003","PURPOSE. TGFBR1*6A is a hypomorphic polymorphic allele of the type I transforming growth factor beta receptor (TGFBR1). TGFBR1*6A is a candidate tumor susceptibility allele that has been associated with an increased incidence of various types of cancer. This study was undertaken to analyze all published case-control studies on TGFBR1*6A and cancer and determine whether TGFBR1*6A is associated with cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS. All published case-control studies assessing the germline frequency of TGFBR1*6A were included. Studies assessing TGFBR1*6A in tumors were excluded. The results of seven studies comprising 2,438 cases and 1,846 controls were pooled and analyzed. RESULTS. Overall, TGFBR1*6A carriers have a 26% increased risk of cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07 to 1.49). Cancer risk for TGFBR1*6A homozygotes (OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.39 to 4.61) is twice that of TGFBR1*6A heterozygotes (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.51). Analysis of various types of tumors shows that TGFBR1*6A carriers are at increased risk of developing breast cancer (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.96), hematological malignancies (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.54), and ovarian cancer (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.17). Carriers of TGFBR1*6A who are from the United States are at increased risk of colorectal cancer (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.86). However, Southern European TGFBR1*6A carriers have no increased colorectal cancer risk. There is no association between TGFBR1*6A and bladder cancer. CONCLUSION. TGFBR1*6A is emerging as a highfrequency, low-penetrance tumor susceptibility allele that predisposes to the development of breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer, as well as hematologic malignancies.","12947057","VD","12947056","2"
"Prevalence and clinical impact of Met Y1253D-activating point mutation in radiotherapy-treated squamous cell cancer of the oropharynx.","2003","Aberrant signalling through the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor receptor Met has been implicated in various aspects of the development of human cancer including the promotion of tumour invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. Moreover, experimental data indicate that activation of the Met receptor may be involved in cellular resistance towards antineoplastic treatments such as chemotherapy and ionizing radiation. We determined the prevalence and clinical impact of the Met-activating mutation Y1253D in patients with squamous cell cancer of the oropharynx treated by radical radiotherapy. To screen archival tissue for the presence of a low-abundance point mutation, we developed a sensitive screening method using real-time polymerase chain reaction along with peptide nucleic acid-based DNA clamping and melting curve analysis. By this approach, Met Y1253D was detected in tumours of 15 out of 138 patients (10.9%). Both univariate and multivariate survival analysis revealed Met Y1253D to be significantly associated with impaired local tumour control. Our results provide evidence that the Met-activating mutation Y1253D is present in a notable subset of patients with oropharyngeal cancer and indicate that it may interfere with radioresponsiveness of these tumours, supporting the notion of aberrant Met signalling as a potential target for radiosensitization.","14627992","IVD","14627992","1"
"beta1-integrin mediates asbestos-induced phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 in a rat pleural mesothelial cell line.","2003","Integrin-mediated signalling has been implicated in asbestos-induced carcinogenesis. In studies here, we examined signal transduction events associated with integrin-directed cell reactions triggered by crocidolite asbestos in the pleural mesothelial cell line 4/4 RM-4. Crocidolite fibres induced a significant time- and dose-dependent activation of the extracellular-signal-regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2. ERK activation was specifically inhibited by integrin-blocking agents, that are integrin-binding peptides containing the sequence arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD), and monoclonal antibodies against the integrin beta1-chain. Integrin-dependent activation of ERK1/2 in response to asbestos appeared to be independent of focal adhesion kinase pp125FAK (FAK) since FAK autophosphorylation remained unaffected in crocidolite-exposed mesothelial cells. Instead, we observed striking similarities in the kinetics of asbestos-induced ERK1/2 responses and phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT) at serine 473, a possible target residue for integrin-linked kinase. As with ERK activation, asbestos-induced AKT stimulation was significantly blocked by both the RGD-peptide and the beta1-integrin antibodies. These studies are the first to establish that in mesothelial cells ERK1/2 and AKT are simultaneously phosphorylated upon asbestos exposure in a beta1-integrin-dependent manner.","14627993","IVD","14627992","2"
"BRAF mutations characterize colon but not gastric cancer with mismatch repair deficiency.","2003","Genes from the RAF family are Ras-regulated kinases involved in growth cellular responses. Recently, a V599E hotspot mutation within the BRAF gene was reported in a high percentage of colorectal tumors and significantly associated to defective mismatch repair (MMR). Additionally, BRAF mutations were described only in K-Ras-negative colon carcinomas, suggesting that BRAF/K-Ras activating mutations might be alternative genetic events in colon cancer. We have addressed to what extent the tumorigenic-positive selection exerted by BRAF mutations seen in colorectal MMR-deficient tumors was also involved in the tumorigenesis of gastric cancer. Accordingly, BRAF mutations were detected in 34% (25/74) of colorectal MMR-deficient tumors and in 5% (7/142) of MMR-proficient colorectal cases (P=0.0001). All mutations found in the MSI cases corresponded to the previously reported hotspot V599E. Two D593K and a K600E additional mutations were also detected in three MSS cases. However, only one mutation of BRAF was found within 124 MSS gastric tumors and none in 37 MSI gastric tumors, clearly suggesting that BRAF mutations are not involved in gastric tumorigenesis. Nonetheless, a high incidence of mutations of K-Ras was found within the MSI gastric group of tumors (P=0.0005), suggesting that the activation of K-Ras-dependent pathways contributes to the tumorigenesis of gastric cancers with MMR deficiency. Accordingly, our results show evidences that BRAF mutations characterize colon but not gastric tumors with MMR deficiency and are not involved in the tumorigenesis of gastric cancer of the mutator phenotype pathway.","14668801","IVD","14668801","1"
"Derivation of embryonic germ cells and male gametes from embryonic stem cells.","2004","Egg and sperm cells (gametes) of the mouse are derived from a founder population of primordial germ cells that are set aside early in embryogenesis. Primordial germ cells arise from the proximal epiblast, a region of the early mouse embryo that also contributes to the first blood lineages of the embryonic yolk sac. Embryonic stem cells differentiate in vitro into cystic structures called embryoid bodies consisting of tissue lineages typical of the early mouse embryo. Because embryoid bodies sustain blood development, we reasoned that they might also support primordial germ cell formation. Here we isolate primordial germ cells from embryoid bodies, and derive continuously growing lines of embryonic germ cells. Embryonic germ cells show erasure of the methylation markers (imprints) of the Igf2r and H19 genes, a property characteristic of the germ lineage. We show that embryoid bodies support maturation of the primordial germ cells into haploid male gametes, which when injected into oocytes restore the somatic diploid chromosome complement and develop into blastocysts. Our ability to derive germ cells from embryonic stem cells provides an accessible in vitro model system for studies of germline epigenetic modification and mammalian gametogenesis.","14668819","IVD","14668801","2"
"KIT mutations are common in testicular seminomas.","2004","Expression of KIT tyrosine kinase is critical for normal germ cell development and is observed in the majority of seminomas. Activating mutations in KIT are common in gastrointestinal stromal tumors and mastocytosis. In this study we examined the frequency and spectrum of KIT mutations in 54 testicular seminomas, 1 ovarian dysgerminoma and 37 non-seminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT). Fourteen seminomas (25.9%) contained exon 17 point mutations including D816V (6 cases), D816H (3 cases), Y823D (2 cases), and single examples of Y823C, N822K, and T801I. No KIT mutations were found in the ovarian dysgerminoma or the NSGCTs. In transient transfection assays, mutant isoforms D816V, D816H, Y823D, and N822K were constitutively phosphorylated in the absence of the natural ligand for KIT, stem cell factor (SCF). In contrast, activation of T801I and wild-type KIT required SCF. Mutants N822K and Y823D were inhibited by imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, previously STI571) whereas D816V and D816H were both resistant to imatinib mesylate. Biochemical evidence of KIT activation, as assessed by KIT phosphorylation and KIT association with phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase in tumor cell lysates, was largely confined to seminomas with a genomic KIT mutation. These findings suggest that activating KIT mutations may contribute to tumorigenesis in a subset of seminomas, but are not involved in NSGCT.","14695343","IVD","14695343","1"
"Detection of differentially expressed genes in an isogenic breast metastasis model using RNA arbitrarily primed-polymerase chain reaction coupled with array hybridization (RAP-array).","2004","To facilitate the study of the mechanisms of breast cancer metastasis we have previously characterized a pair of breast tumor cell lines that originate from the same breast tumor cell line MDA-MB-435, but which have diametrically opposite metastatic capabilities. These cell lines constitute a stable and accessible experimental system for the identification of metastasis-related genes and for the study of their role in the process of metastasis. In this study, we used a combination of RNA arbitrarily primed-polymerase chain reaction (RAP-PCR) fingerprinting and cDNA arrays (here termed ""RAP-array"") to identify genes differentially expressed with respect to metastatic phenotype. RAP-PCR was used to generate radioactive probes of reduced complexity for hybridization to nylon membranes containing 588 cDNAs of known identity. Single RAP-PCR fingerprint probes hybridized from 61 (10.4%) to 116 (19.7%) of the filter array targets, with a signal detection overlap of approximately 21%. A total of 344 (57%) of the 588 target genes were detected by five single RAP-PCR fingerprints. The advantage of using reduced complexity probes was highlighted by the fact that the combination of RAP probes before hybridization compromised the overall detection rate by up to 40%. Sequential application of RAP-PCR probes allowed the screening of a greater, and an alternative fraction of the transcript population than was achieved with a radiolabeled total cDNA probe. Verification by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR confirmed significantly increased expression of keratin 9 (>100-fold) in nonmetastatic breast tumor cells and of CD70 (fivefold) in metastatic cells. The differential expression of keratin 9 and CD70 was maintained between cells grown as primary xenografts in athymic mice. The RAP-array method enabled the detection of genes not revealed using other screening methods and that are candidates for further investigation in the context of metastatic phenotype.","14695344","IVD","14695343","2"
"High incidence of BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations and absence of mutations of the PDGFR and KIT activation loops in CML patients with secondary resistance to imatinib.","2004","Imatinib, a specific inhibitor of the Abl, Kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) tyrosine kinases, is effective in all phases of chronic myelogenous leukemia. While responses in chronic phase are usually durable, resistance frequently develops in patients with advanced disease after an initial response. Several mechanisms of resistance have been demonstrated in vivo, including mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain and amplification of the BCR-ABL gene. We analyzed cytogenetics and screened for mutations of the BCR-ABL kinase domain as well as the activation loops of KIT and PDGFRA and B in 49 patients with CML or Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia with resistance to imatinib. Mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL were detected in 51.6% of patients with secondary resistance but not in patients with primary resistance. Three of these mutations have not been described before (T315D, F359D and D276G). By contrast, KIT and PDGFRA and B were consistently wildtype. Clonal evolution prior to imatinib was present in 68.8% of patients with primary resistance and in 45.5% with secondary resistance. Additional cytogenetic aberrations developed in 18.2% of patients at the time of relapse. Our results confirm the high frequency of BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations in patients with secondary resistance to imatinib and exclude mutations of the activation loops of KIT, PDGFRA and PDGFRB as possible causes of resistance in patients without ABL mutations.","14745431","IVD","14745431","1"
"Use of polymorphisms in the noncoding region of the human mitochondrial genome to identify potential contamination of human leukemia-lymphoma cell lines.","2004","The availability of the complete sequence of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has proven extremely useful in phylogenetic studies, forensic science and the determination of chimerism after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In this study, we could demonstrate that the analysis of mtDNA polymorphisms is a quick and reliable method to identify contamination of human hematopoietic cell lines. This assay is based on PCR-sequencing of three hypervariable segments of the control region of mtDNA (hypervariable region (HRV) 1, 2 and 3). All three regions contain a large number of single-base polymorphisms. mtDNA was isolated according to standard laboratory procedures and amplified by PCR. Subsequently products were sequenced and evaluated with a semiautomated DNA sequencer system. So far, 21 human leukemia-lymphoma (LL) cell lines and nine other human cell lines were screened for contamination by other cell lines applying this method. We conclude that analysis of mtDNA polymorphisms is a quick, reliable and inexpensive method to detect intra - and interspecies cross-contamination and for the authentication of human LL cell lines. In comparison to other methods (cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization or immunophenotyping), this technique is less laborious and time consuming.","14745432","IVD","14745431","2"
"EGFR mutations in lung cancer: correlation with clinical response to gefitinib therapy.","2004","Receptor tyrosine kinase genes were sequenced in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and matched normal tissue. Somatic mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene EGFR were found in 15of 58 unselected tumors from Japan and 1 of 61 from the United States. Treatment with the EGFR kinase inhibitor gefitinib (Iressa) causes tumor regression in some patients with NSCLC, more frequently in Japan. EGFR mutations were found in additional lung cancer samples from U.S. patients who responded to gefitinib therapy and in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line that was hypersensitive to growth inhibition by gefitinib, but not in gefitinib-insensitive tumors or cell lines. These results suggest that EGFR mutations may predict sensitivity to gefitinib.","15118125","VD","15118125","1"

A superconductivity-induced transfer of the spectral weight involving a high-energy scale in excess of 1 electron volt was observed. Correspondingly, the charge carrier spectral weight was shown to decrease in the superconducting state.

"A great majority of GISTs with PDGFRA mutations represent gastric tumors of low or no malignant potential.","2004","Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are KIT expressing spindle cell, epithelioid and rarely pleomorphic mesenchymal tumors. The majority of GISTs show gain-of-function KIT mutations. However, GISTs without KIT mutations and GISTs with weak or lack of immunohistochemical KIT expression have also been reported. Recently, gain-of-function mutations in exon 18 (activation loop) and exon 12 (juxtamembrane domain) of the PDGFRA were identified in such tumors. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that PDGFRA mutation may define a specific clinicopathologic subgroup of GISTs. A total of 447 KIT exon 11 (juxtamembrane domain) mutation-negative GISTs were studied. DNA samples were obtained from formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Genomic sequences of PDGFRA exons 18 and 12 were evaluated for the mutations by PCR amplification and direct sequencing. PDGFRA exon 18 mutations were identified in 122 of 346 (35.3%) gastric GISTs and two of 75 (2.7%) intestinal GISTs. A great majority of these mutations represented simple T to A missense mutation at the codon 842 leading to substitution of the valine for aspartic acid (D842 V). However, in-frame deletions and deletions with point mutations clustering between codons 841-847 were found in approximately 23% of all exon 18 mutations. Mutations in PDGFRA exon 12 were found only in 10 of 170 (5.8%) gastric and one of 54 (1.9%) intestinal GISTs negative for KIT exon 11 and PDGFRA exon 18 mutations. There were seven substitutions of aspartic acid for valine at codon 561 (V561D) and four in-frame deletions with point mutations clustering between codons 566 and 571. The majority of GISTs with PDGFRA mutations had pure or predominant epithelioid morphology. Low mitotic activity, < or =5 mitoses/50HPF was detected in 81% of analyzed GISTs including larger, >5 cm tumors. Based on long-term follow-up (average 135 months), a majority (83.5%) of GISTs with PDGFRA mutations followed a benign course.","15146165","IVD","15146165","1"
"Two different types of amyloid deposits--apolipoprotein A-IV and transthyretin--in a patient with systemic amyloidosis.","2004","Certain forms of systemic amyloidosis have been associated with the pathologic deposition as fibrils of three different apolipoprotein-related proteins--apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein A-II, and serum amyloid A. We have previously reported (Bergström et al, Biochem Biophys Res Commun 2001;285:903-908) that amyloid fibrils extracted from the heart of an elderly male with senile systemic amyloidosis contained, in addition to wild-type transthyretin-related molecules, an N-terminal fragment of yet a fourth apolipoprotein--apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV). We now provide the results of our studies that have established the complete amino-acid sequence of this approximately 70-residue component and, additionally, have shown this protein to be the product of an unmutated apoA-IV gene. Notably, the apoA-IV and transthyretin fibrils were not codeposited but, rather, had anatomically distinct patterns of distribution within the heart and other organs, as evidenced immunohistochemically, by variation in the ultra structural morphology and by differences in the intensity of Congo red birefringence. These findings provide the first conclusive evidence that two separate forms of amyloid, each derived from a wild-type amyloidogenic precursor protein, were present in a patient with systemic amyloidosis.","15146166","IVD","15146165","2"
"Different effects of point mutations within the B-Raf glycine-rich loop in colorectal tumors on mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase and nuclear factor kappaB pathway and cellular transformation.","2004","Recently, mutations in the B-Raf gene have been identified in a variety of human cancers, such as melanoma and colorectal carcinoma, and more than 80% of the B-Raf mutations have been V599E. Although other mutations have been reported, their functional consequences are poorly understood. In our earlier study, we demonstrated that colon tumor-associated B-Raf mutations within the kinase activation segment are not necessarily associated with an increase in mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/Erk) or nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) signaling activity or in NIH3T3-transforming ability. In this study, we examined the effect of colon tumor-associated mutations within the B-Raf glycine-rich loop (G loop) on MEK/Erk and NFkappaB signaling and on the transformation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts or IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cells. Of the six G loop mutations examined, only the B-Raf G468A significantly increased MEK/Erk and NFkappaB signaling and NIH3T3 transformation. Only this mutation induced transformed phenotypes of IEC-6 cells. In contrast, the B-Raf G468E mutation significantly decreased MEK/Erk signaling and NIH3T3 transformation and had no effect on NFkappaB signaling. The B-Raf F467C mutation moderately elevated MEK/Erk signaling and NIH3T3 transformation. The other three B-Raf mutations, R461I, I462S, and G463E, did not increase MEK/Erk or NFkappaB signaling or NIH3T3 transformation. Except for F467C, none of the tumors with B-Raf mutations examined in this study had K-Ras mutations. These results suggest that some of the B-Raf G loop mutations reported in colorectal tumors do not increase kinase or transforming activities but might contribute to carcinogenesis via other mechanisms or be irrelevant to carcinogenesis.","15150094","VD","15150094","1"
"Perturbed IFN-gamma-Jak-signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling in tuberous sclerosis mouse models: synergistic effects of rapamycin-IFN-gamma treatment.","2004","Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by widespread development of hamartomas, which is caused by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2. We demonstrate a dramatic decrease of IFN-gamma expression in tumors and mouse embryo fibroblast cell lines that lack either Tsc1 or Tsc2, which is reversed by rapamycin (mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor) therapy. Increased signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 expression and phosphorylation at Ser 727 and increased pSTAT3 Tyr705 levels also are seen in Tsc1 null and Tsc2 null cells and in tumors. Treatment of Tsc1 or Tsc2 null cells with IFN-gamma induces apoptosis, in contrast to control cell lines, with reduction in pSTAT3 Tyr705 levels and major increases in pSTAT1 Tyr701, bax, and caspase-1 and -9 levels. A combination of IFN-gamma and rapamycin is markedly synergistic in induction of apoptosis in Tsc1 or Tsc2 null cells because pSTAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation is abolished completely and the other effects of IFN-gamma are maintained or enhanced. Rapamycin-IFN-gamma has unique potential therapeutic benefit for management of TSC tumors.","15150095","VD","15150094","2"
"Differential expression of KIT/PDGFRA mutant isoforms in epithelioid and mixed variants of gastrointestinal stromal tumors depends predominantly on the tumor site.","2004","Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) form a distinctive group of mesenchymal neoplasms, showing differentiation towards the interstitial cells of Cajal. Morphologically, GISTs vary from cellular spindle cell tumors to epithelioid or mixed, epithelioid and spindle cell variants. The genotypic features underlying the morphologic differences of GISTs with vs without epithelioid components are not well defined. Acquisition of activating mutations in KIT and PDGFRA has been reported as alternative oncogenic events in the pathogenesis of GISTs. In this study, a comprehensive KIT and PDGFRA mutational analysis was performed in a group of 28 epithelioid/mixed type tumors, in order to explore whether a specific KIT/PDGFRA mutational status segregates these neoplasms from spindle cell variant GISTs. All GISTs were primary neoplasms, 16 (57.1%) originated from the stomach and 12 (42.8%) from other locations. Histomorphologically, 14 GISTs showed an epithelioid and 14 a mixed cell type pattern. Mutational analysis included KIT exons 9, 11, 13, and 17, and PDGFRA exons 12 and 18 prescreening by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, followed by direct sequencing. Activating mutations of KIT were found in 14 (50%) GISTs, the majority being within exon 11 (n=11; 39.2%), and the other comprised exon 9 AY 502-503 duplications (n=2; 7.2%) and exon 17 Lys --> Aln822 missense mutations (n=1; 3.6%). Most of the KIT mutant tumors (n=11; 78.6%) originated from nongastric sites. Seven (25.0%) GISTs with no detectable KIT mutations demonstrated PDGFRA mutant isoforms, carrying either D842 V mutations (n=5) or exon 18 deletions (n=2). All GISTs harboring PDGFRA mutant isoforms originated from the stomach. In seven tumors, no detectable mutations were found; all but one of nonmutant tumors initiated from the stomach and exhibited an epithelioid morphology. These findings indicate that the mutational status of epithelioid/mixed GISTs associates with the anatomical site of the tumor.","15154005","IVD","15154005","1"
"Prognostic relevance of histological grade and its components in node-negative breast cancer patients.","2004","Available results highlight the lack of good level of evidence studies on the pure prognostic value of histological grade. In the present study, the prognostic relevance of histological grade and of its three components, tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic count, was analyzed in a series of 372 patients with node-negative breast cancer treated with locoregional therapy alone until early relapse. Histological grade was determined blindly by two observers and discordance between evaluations was resolved after joint review using a multihead microscope. No relation was observed between histological grade and any of its three components and disease-free survival. Conversely, a significant relation was observed between histological grade and distant metastasis-free survival (at 6 years, 94, 86 and 76% for grades 1, 2 and 3, respectively, P=0.013) as well as overall survival (98, 90 and 86%, P=0.001). A breakdown analysis as a function of the three components showed that neither tubule formation nor nuclear pleomorphism was associated with prognosis, and only mitotic count strongly influenced both distant metastasis-free survival (91, 82 and 74%, P=0.014) and overall survival (97, 87 and 85%, P=0.011). Histological grade suffers from a much higher subjectivity than any other microscopic evaluation of biomarkers as it is the sum of three different morphological features. Within the Italian Network for Quality Assessment of Tumor Biomarkers program we observed that histological grade is an independent prognostic variable, but also that this role is ascribable only to the number of mitotic figures. In conclusion, due to the ever smaller size of diagnosed breast cancers, resulting in less cancer tissue for biofunctional and molecular analysis, mitotic count evaluated under strict quality control conditions seems to be an accurate and feasible prognostic variable.","15154006","IVD","15154005","2"

These results demonstrate that PIK3CA is the most mutated oncogene in breast cancer and support a role for PIK3CA in epithelial carcinogenesis.","15254419","IVD","15254419","1"
"Comparison of genetic changes between interphase and metaphase nuclei in monitoring CML and APL treatment using DC-FISH technique.","2004","In leukemias, the monitoring techniques on the response after the treatment have clinical importance for evaluating new therapeutic approaches and identifying the risk of relapse. In this study, genetic changes before and after chemotherapy in interphase and metaphase nuclei of bone morrow of adults with provisional diagnosis of leukemia were compared to understand the molecular characterization and pathogenesis of the leukemia for the classification of diagnosis and prognosis. We examined bone morrow cells of 47 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cases (29 of 47 at the time of diagnosis, 31 of 47 after chemotherapy) with the bcr/abl translocation probes and of 10 acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cases (7 of 10 at the time of diagnosis, 4 of 10 after chemotherapy) with the PML/RARalpha translocation probes by using dual color-flourescence in situ hybridization (DC-FISH). For each case, 400 interphase nuclei and 11 to 25 metaphases nuclei were analysed. The ratios of translocations before and after chemotherapy were compared between interphase and metaphase nuclei. After chemotherapy, though, translocations were detected in interphase nuclei of 29 of the 31 CML and 4 of the 4 APL cases, these translocations were determined in metaphase nuclei of only 14 of the 31 CML and 1 of the 4 APL cases with very low ratios (p < 0.01). The results showed that the rates of translocation positive interphase nuclei were higher than the rates of translocation positive metaphase nuclei (p < 0.01) after chemotherapy, so there may be some factors effecting proliferative activity of metaphase formation in leukemias.","15254420","IVD","15254419","2"

"A supernova origin for dust in a high-redshift quasar.","2004","Interstellar dust plays a crucial role in the evolution of the Universe by assisting the formation of molecules, by triggering the formation of the first low-mass stars, and by absorbing stellar ultraviolet-optical light and subsequently re-emitting it at infrared/millimetre wavelengths. Dust is thought to be produced predominantly in the envelopes of evolved (age >1 Gyr), low-mass stars. This picture has, however, recently been brought into question by the discovery of large masses of dust in the host galaxies of quasars at redshift z > 6, when the age of the Universe was less than 1 Gyr. Theoretical studies, corroborated by observations of nearby supernova remnants, have suggested that supernovae provide a fast and efficient dust formation environment in the early Universe. Here we report infrared observations of a quasar at redshift 6.2, which are used to obtain directly its dust extinction curve. We then show that such a curve is in excellent agreement with supernova dust models. This result demonstrates a supernova origin for dust in this high-redshift quasar, from which we infer that most of the dust at high redshifts probably has the same origin.","15457250","IVD","15457249","2"

"Mechanisms of resistance to imatinib mesylate in gastrointestinal stromal tumors and activity of the PKC412 inhibitor against imatinib-resistant mutants.","2005","BACKGROUND AND AIMS. Resistance is a major challenge in the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). We investigated the mechanisms of resistance in patients with progressive GISTs with primary KIT mutations and the efficacy of the kinase inhibitor PKC412 for the inhibition of imatinib-resistant mutants. METHODS. We performed a cytogenetic analysis and screened for mutations of the KIT and PDGFRA kinase domains in 26 resistant GISTs. KIT autophosphorylation status was assessed by Western immunoblotting. Imatinib-resistant GIST cells and Ba/F3 cells expressing these mutant proteins were tested for sensitivity to imatinib and PKC412. RESULTS. Six distinct secondary mutations in KIT were detected in 12 progressive tumors, with V654A and T670I found to be recurrent. One progressive tumor showed acquired PDGFRA -D842V mutation. Amplification of KIT or KIT / PDGFRA was found in 2 patients. Eight of 10 progressive tumors available for analysis showed phosphorylated KIT. Two remaining progressive tumors lost KIT protein expression. GIST cells carrying KIT -del557-558/T670I or KIT -InsAY502-503/V654A mutations were resistant to imatinib, while PKC412 significantly inhibited autophosporylation of these mutants. Resistance to imatinib and sensitivity to PKC412 of KIT -T670I and PDGFRA -D842V mutants was confirmed using Ba/F3 cells. CONCLUSIONS. This study shows the high frequency of KIT/PDGFRA kinase domain mutations in patients with secondary resistance and defines genomic amplification of KIT / PDGFRA as an alternative cause of resistance to the drug. In a subset of patients, cancer cells lost their dependence on the targeted tyrosine kinase. Our findings show the sensitivity of the imatinib-resistant KIT -T670I and KIT -V654A and of PDGFRA -D842V mutants to PKC412.","15685537","IVD","15685537","1"
"Screening behavior of individuals at high risk for colorectal cancer.","2005","BACKGROUND AND AIMS. Periodic colonoscopy is an effective means of reducing the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer in individuals with a family history of the disease. The aims of this study were to determine the degree of compliance and to identify the factors related significantly to noncompliance with periodic screening in this high-risk population. METHODS. A total of 178 individuals who had undergone genetic counseling for colorectal cancer between 1986 and 1998 and who had been advised to undergo periodic screening because of familial colorectal cancer (FCRC) or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) were invited to complete a self-report questionnaire on psychosocial issues and screening experiences. Compliance data were derived from medical records and via self-report. RESULTS. A total of 149 individuals (84%) participated in the study. Noncompliance with screening advice was rare (in 3% of cases), but significant delays (more than 1 year) in undergoing screening were observed in approximately 25% of the cases. The number of perceived barriers to screening (eg, discomfort, embarrassment) was the only variable related significantly to noncompliance/screening delay (odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.3). Use of sedatives during the procedure and receipt of a reminder letter seemed to facilitate better compliance. CONCLUSIONS. Although few high-risk individuals abstain from screening entirely, approximately one in 4 deviates significantly from the recommended frequency of screening. Increased compliance may be achieved by reducing the discomfort and embarrassment associated with the procedure and by the use of reminder letters.","15685539","IVD","15685537","2"
"Predictive and prognostic impact of epidermal growth factor receptor mutation in non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with gefitinib.","2005","PURPOSE. This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and its downstream signaling on response and survival in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with gefitinib. PATIENTS AND METHODS. For 90 consecutive NSCLC patients who had received gefitinib, EGFR mutation was analyzed by DNA sequencing of exons 18, 19, 21, and 23 in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain. Expressions of phosphorylated (p) -Akt and p-Erk were determined via immunohistochemistry. Response rate, time to progression (TTP), and overall survival were compared between each group according to EGFR mutation, as well as p-Akt and p-Erk expression. RESULTS. Seventeen patients (18.9%; 95% CI, 10.8 to 27.0) harbored EGFR mutations. These mutations include deletions in exon 19 in seven patients, L858R in six patients, G719A in three patients, and a novel A859T in one patient. Response rate in patients with EGFR mutation was 64.7% (11 of 17 patients; 95% CI, 42.0 to 87.4), in contrast to 13.7% (10 of 73 patients; 95% CI, 5.8 to 21.6) in patients without mutation (P < .001). Moreover, these 17 patients with EGFR mutation had significantly prolonged TTP (21.7 v 1.8 months; P < .001) and overall survival (30.5 v 6.6 months; P < .001) compared with the remaining 73 patients without mutation. Although no significant correlation was detected between EGFR mutation and expressions of p-Akt or p-Erk, p-Akt overexpression was associated with prolonged TTP in patients with EGFR mutation. CONCLUSION. Our data further support the importance of EGFR mutation with regard to gefitinib sensitivity. In addition to its predictive role, EGFR mutation confers significant survival benefits on NSCLC patients treated with gefitinib.","15710947","IB","15710947","1"
"Neoadjuvant trastuzumab induces apoptosis in primary breast cancers.","2005","PURPOSE. Greater understanding of the cellular response in trastuzumab-treated patients will provide insight into the clinical management of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS. We performed a neoadjuvant trial in 35 patients with locally advanced HER-2/neu overexpressing breast cancers who received weekly trastuzumab given as a single agent for the first 3 weeks, followed by a combination of trastuzumab and docetaxel for 12 weeks before surgery. Sequential core biopsies were taken at baseline and within weeks 1 and 3 after the first dose of trastuzumab. Clinical response to trastuzumab was assessed by tumor measurements on day 22 before chemotherapy. Core biopsies were assessed by immunohistochemistry for cell cycle and proliferation (Ki67, p27, phosphorylated [p] -MAPK), apoptosis and survival (apoptotic index, p-Akt), epidermal growth factor receptor, and total and p-HER-2. RESULTS. There was early tumor regression with a median decrease of -20.0% (range. 0% to 60.4%) after only 3 weeks of trastuzumab, and eight patients (23%) had a partial response. Consistent with the clinical regressions, apoptosis was significantly induced (median increase from 3.5% to 4.7%; P = .006) within week 1, a 35% increase above baseline. No significant change in epidermal growth factor receptor score was observed in week 1, without changes in total or p-HER-2 expression. Tumors with high baseline Ki67 were less likely to respond (P = .02). CONCLUSION. In primary breast cancers, trastuzumab substantially induces apoptosis, providing a molecular explanation for both its therapeutic efficacy and its successful combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy.","15710948","IB","15710947","2"
"Clinical and biological features associated with epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations in lung cancers.","2005","BACKGROUND. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in lung cancers are associated with increased sensitivity of these cancers to drugs that inhibit EGFR kinase activity. However, the role of such mutations in the pathogenesis of lung cancers is unclear. METHODS. We sequenced exons 18-21 of the EGFR TK domain from genomic DNA isolated from 617 non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and 524 normal lung tissue samples from the same patients and 36 neuroendocrine lung tumors collected from patients in Japan, Taiwan, the United States, and Australia and from 243 other epithelial cancers. Mutation status was compared with clinicopathologic features and with the presence of mutations in KRAS, a gene in the EGFR signaling pathway that is also frequently mutated in lung cancers. All statistical tests were two sided. RESULTS. We detected a total of 134 EGFR TK domain mutations in 130 (21%) of the 617 NSCLCs but not in any of the other carcinomas, nor in nonmalignant lung tissue from the same patients. In NSCLC patients, EGFR TK domain mutations were statistically significantly more frequent in never smokers than ever smokers (51% versus 10%), in adenocarcinomas versus cancer of other histologies (40% versus 3%), in patients of East Asian ethnicity versus other ethnicities (30% versus 8%), and in females versus males (42% versus 14%; all P < .001). EGFR TK domain mutation status was not associated with patient age at diagnosis, clinical stage, the presence of bronchioloalveolar histologic features, or overall survival. The EGFR TK domain mutations we detected were of three common types: in-frame deletions in exon 19, single missense mutations in exon 21, and in-frame duplications/insertions in exon 20. Rare missense mutations were also detected in exons 18, 20, and 21. KRAS gene mutations were present in 50 (8%) of the 617 NSCLCs but not in any tumors with an EGFR TK domain mutation. CONCLUSIONS. Mutations in either the EGFR TK domain or the KRAS gene can lead to lung cancer pathogenesis. EGFR TK domain mutations are the first molecular change known to occur specifically in never smokers.","15741570","IVD","15741570","1"
"Randomized trial of different screening strategies for colorectal cancer: patient response and detection rates.","2005","BACKGROUND. Although there is general consensus concerning the efficacy of colorectal cancer screening, there is a lack of agreement about which routine screening strategy should be adopted. We compared the participation and detection rates achievable through different strategies of colorectal cancer screening. METHODS. From November 1999 through June 2001 we conducted a multicenter, randomized trial in Italy among a sample of 55-64 year olds in the general population who had an average risk of colorectal cancer. People with previous colorectal cancer, adenomas, inflammatory bowel disease, a recent (< or =2 years) colorectal endoscopy or fecal occult blood test (FOBT), or two first-degree relatives with colorectal cancer were excluded. Eligible subjects were randomly assigned, within the roster of their general practitioner, to 1) biennial FOBT (delivered by mail), 2) biennial FOBT (delivered by general practitioner or a screening facility), 3) patient's choice of FOBT or ""once-only"" sigmoidoscopy, 4) ""once-only"" sigmoidoscopy, or 5) sigmoidoscopy followed by biennial FOBT. An immunologic FOBT was used. Participation and detection rates of the strategies tested were compared using multivariable logistic regression models that adjusted for age, sex, and screening center. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS. Of 28 319 people sampled, 1637 were excluded and 26 682 were randomly assigned to a screening arm. After excluding undelivered letters (n = 427), the participation rates for groups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 30.1% (682/2266), 28.1% (1654/5893), 27.1% (970/3579), 28.1% (1026/3650), and 28.1% (3049/10 867), respectively. Of the 2858 subjects screened by FOBT, 122 (4.3%) had a positive test result, 10 (3.5 per 1000) had colorectal cancer, and 39 (1.4%) had an advanced adenoma. Among the 4466 subjects screened by sigmoidoscopy, 341 (7.6%) were referred for colonoscopy, 18 (4 per 1000) had colorectal cancer, and 229 (5.1%) harbored an advanced adenoma. CONCLUSIONS. The participation rates were similar for sigmoidoscopy and FOBT. The detection rate for advanced neoplasia was three times higher following screening by sigmoidoscopy than by FOBT.","15741571","IVD","15741570","2"
"Somatic mutations of the HER2 kinase domain in lung adenocarcinomas.","2005","Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) in lung cancers predict for sensitivity to EGFR kinase inhibitors. HER2 (also known as NEU, EGFR2, or ERBB2) is a member of the EGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases and plays important roles in the pathogenesis of certain human cancers, and mutations have recently been reported in lung cancers. We sequenced the tyrosine kinase domain of HER2 in 671 primary non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), 80 NSCLC cell lines, and 55 SCLCs and other neuroendocrine lung tumors as well as 85 other epithelial cancers (breast, bladder, prostate, and colorectal cancers) and compared the mutational status with clinicopathologic features and the presence of EGFR or KRAS mutations. HER2 mutations were present in 1.6% (11 of 671) of NSCLC and were absent in other types of cancers. Only one adenocarcinoma cell line (NCI-H1781) had a mutation. All HER2 mutations were in-frame insertions in exon 20 and target the identical corresponding region as did EGFR insertions. HER2 mutations were significantly more frequent in never smokers (3.2%, 8 of 248; P=0.02) and adenocarcinoma histology (2.8%, 11 of 394; P=0.003). In 394 adenocarcinoma cases, HER2 mutations preferentially targeted Oriental ethnicity (3.9%) compared with other ethnicities (0.7%), female gender (3.6%) compared with male gender (1.9%) and never smokers (4.1%) compared with smokers (1.4%). Mutations in EGFR, HER2, and KRAS genes were never present together in individual tumors and cell lines. The remarkable similarities of mutations in EGFR and HER2 genes involving tumor type and subtype, mutation type, gene location, and specific patient subpopulations targeted are unprecedented and suggest similar etiologic factors. EGFR, HER2, and KRAS mutations are mutually exclusive, suggesting different pathways to lung cancer in smokers and never smokers.","15753357","VD","15753357","1"
"PUMA overexpression induces reactive oxygen species generation and proteasome-mediated stathmin degradation in colorectal cancer cells.","2005","Increased amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce apoptosis in mammalian cells. PUMA (P53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis), a mitochondrial proapoptotic BH3-only protein, induces rapid apoptosis through a Bax- and mitochondria-dependent pathway. However, the molecular basis of PUMA-induced apoptosis is largely not understood. Using a combination of biophysical and biochemical methods and PUMA-inducible colorectal cells, DLD-1.PUMA, we showed that (a) PUMA-induced apoptosis is dose and time dependent; (b) PUMA-induced apoptosis is directly associated with ROS generation; (c) diphenyleneiodonium chloride, a ROS blocker, or BAX-inhibiting peptide, a suppressor of BAX translocation, decreased ROS generation and apoptosis in DLD-1.PUMA cells; (d) overexpression of PUMA induced up-regulation (>1.34-fold) of peroxiredoxin 1 and down-regulation (by 25%) of stathmin through proteasome-mediated degradation; and (e) hydrogen peroxide down-regulated stathmin and disrupted the cellular microtubule network. Our findings indicate that PUMA induces apoptosis, in part, through the BAX-dependent generation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. ROS overproduction and oxidative stress induce proteome-wise alterations, such as stathmin degradation and disorganization of the cell microtubule network, in apoptotic cells.","15753358","VD","15753357","2"
"Acquired mutation of the tyrosine kinase JAK2 in human myeloproliferative disorders.","2005 Mar 19-25","BACKGROUND. Human myeloproliferative disorders form a range of clonal haematological malignant diseases, the main members of which are polycythaemia vera, essential thrombocythaemia, and idiopathic myelofibrosis. The molecular pathogenesis of these disorders is unknown, but tyrosine kinases have been implicated in several related disorders. We investigated the role of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase JAK2 in patients with a myeloproliferative disorder. METHODS. We obtained DNA samples from patients with polycythaemia vera, essential thrombocythaemia, or idiopathic myelofibrosis. The coding exons of JAK2 were bidirectionally sequenced from peripheral-blood granulocytes, T cells, or both. Allele-specific PCR, molecular cytogenetic studies, microsatellite PCR, Affymetrix single nucleotide polymorphism array analyses, and colony assays were undertaken on subgroups of patients. FINDINGS. A single point mutation (Val617Phe) was identified in JAK2 in 71 (97%) of 73 patients with polycythaemia vera, 29 (57%) of 51 with essential thrombocythaemia, and eight (50%) of 16 with idiopathic myelofibrosis. The mutation is acquired, is present in a variable proportion of granulocytes, alters a highly conserved valine present in the negative regulatory JH2 domain, and is predicted to dysregulate kinase activity. It was heterozygous in most patients, homozygous in a subset as a result of mitotic recombination, and arose in a multipotent progenitor capable of giving rise to erythroid and myeloid cells. The mutation was present in all erythropoietin-independent erythroid colonies. RELEVANCE TO PRACTICE. Identification of the Val617Phe JAK2 mutation lays the foundation for new approaches to the diagnosis, classification, and treatment of myeloproliferative disorders. INTERPRETATION. A single acquired mutation of JAK2 was noted in more than half of patients with a myeloproliferative disorder. Its presence in all erythropoietin-independent erythroid colonies demonstrates a link with growth factor hypersensitivity, a key biological feature of these disorders.","15781101","IB","15781101","1"
"Deficiency of a subset of T-cells with immunoregulatory properties in sarcoidosis.","2005 Mar 19-25","BACKGROUND. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder that predominantly involves the lungs, characterised by a T-helper 1 (Th1) biased CD4-positive T-cell response and granuloma formation, for which the explanation is unknown. A newly identified subset of T-cells with immunoregulatory functions, CD1d-restricted natural-killer T (NKT) cells, has been shown to protect against disorders with increased CD4-positive Th1 responses in animals. We explored whether abnormalities in these cells are implicated in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis. METHODS. We generated fluorescence-labelled CD1d-tetrameric complexes and used them, with monoclonal antibodies to Valpha24 and Vbeta11 T-cell receptor, to assess the frequency of CD1d-restricted NKT cells in the peripheral blood of 60 patients with histologically proven sarcoidosis (16 with Lofgren's syndrome) and 60 healthy controls. Lung lymphocytes were also analysed in 16 of the patients with sarcoidosis. FINDINGS. CD1d-restricted NKT cells were absent or greatly reduced in peripheral blood from all patients with sarcoidosis, except those with Lofgren's syndrome (median proportion of lymphocytes 0.01% [IQR 0-0.03] vs 0.06% [0.03-0.12] in controls; p=0.0004). The deficiency was found in both acute and resolved disease and was unrelated to systemic corticosteroid therapy. There was no difference in the proportion of CD1d-restricted NKT cells between peripheral blood and lungs in patients, suggesting that the peripheral-blood deficiency is not due to sequestration of these cells in the lungs. The NKT cells were not observed in mediastinal lymph nodes or granulomatous lesions. CD1d expression on antigen-presenting cells of patients was normal, thus the deficiency of CD1d-restricted NKT cells is not explained by abnormal CD1d expression. INTERPRETATION. Loss of immunoregulation by CD1d-restricted NKT cells could explain the amplified and persistent T-cell activity that characterises sarcoidosis. RELEVANCE TO PRACTICE. Our findings give new insight into the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis and draw attention to a potential target for therapeutic modulation in sarcoidosis.","15781102","IB","15781101","2"

An internet-based protocol was used to collect clinical information and biological specimens from patients with these diseases. High-throughput DNA resequencing identified a recurrent somatic missense mutation JAK2V617F in granulocyte DNA samples of 121 of 164 PV patients, of which 41 had homozygous and 80 had heterozygous mutations. Molecular and cytogenetic analyses demonstrated that homozygous mutations were due to duplication of the mutant allele. JAK2V617F was also identified in granulocyte DNA samples from 37 of 115 ET and 16 of 46 MMM patients, but was not observed in 269 normal individuals.

"Growth inhibition of K562 cells by cyclin E gene-specific small interfering RNA.","2005","OBJECTIVE. To study the inhibitory effect of small interference RNA(siRNA) of cyclin E gene on the growth of K562 cells. METHODS. siRNA targeting the 940 bp site of the cyclin E mRNA were designed and generated by PCR amplification. The PCR products containing U6 promoter and the siRNA were then transfected into K562 cells via Lipofectamine2000. The cells transfected with non-functional siRNA served as the negative control group and those only treated with serum-free RPMI1640 as the blank control group. Cell counting, reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and flow cytometry were employed to evaluate the effect of RNA interference. RESULTS. Compared with the negative and blank control groups, the viable cell count in the interference group was decreased by approximately 80%, the ratio of G(1)-phase cells increased by nearly 30%, and growth arrest was observed. Cyclin E mRNA expression in the cells of the interference group was significantly lowered by about 70%; as compared with that of the negative and blank control groups, whereas the latter two groups had similar expression levels. CONCLUSION. RNA interference induces obvious inhibition of cyclin E gene expression, which consequently affects the proliferation of K562 cells.","15837628","IB","15837627","2"
"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors in children and young adults: a clinicopathologic, molecular, and genomic study of 15 cases and review of the literature.","2005","Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are mesenchymal tumors of the intestinal tract that typically occur in adults over the age of 40 years. GISTs in younger patients are rare and not well characterized. The objective was to define the characteristics of GISTs in children and young adults (<30 years old). Clinicopathologic and molecular features, including KIT/PDGFRA genotype, in GISTs from 5 children and 10 young adults were analyzed. Gene expression analysis was performed on 5 gastric tumor samples from 2 children, 2 gastric tumors from young adults, and 10 gastric GISTs from older adults using an U133A Affymetrix platform (22,000 genes). All five pediatric GISTs occurred in girls, involved the stomach as multiple nodules, showed predominantly an epithelioid morphology, often involved lymph nodes, and lacked KIT or PDGFRA mutations. Although all five patients developed recurrence (four in the liver, three in the peritoneum, and two in both sites), four are still alive with disease. Of the 10 GISTs in young adults, half occurred in the small bowel and had spindle cell morphology, and one case had lymph node metastasis. KIT mutations were identified in seven cases, four in exon 11 and three in exon 9. Seven patients developed recurrence, and at last follow-up two patients had died of disease. Gene expression analysis showed high expression of PHKA1, FZD2, NLGN4, IGF1R, and ANK3 in the pediatric and young adult versus older adult cases. GISTs that occur in children are a separate clinicopathologic and molecular subset with predilection for girls, multifocal gastric tumors, and wild-type KIT/PDGFRA genotype. In contrast, GISTs in young adults are a more heterogeneous group, including cases that resemble either the pediatric or the older adult-type tumors. The distinct gene expression profile suggests avenues for investigation of pathogenesis and potential therapeutic strategies.","15838387","VD","15838387","1"
"Prognostic significance of metastatic site at diagnosis in Wilms' tumor: results from a single center.","2005","The purpose of this study was to identify the prognostic significance of pulmonary and liver involvements present at diagnosis in children with Wilms' tumor. From 1971 to 2002, 57 patients with stage IV Wilms' tumor were diagnosed, treated, and followed in the authors' institution. Metastases were detected by chest radiography, abdominal ultrasonography, and/or thoracoabdominal computed tomography. Nephrectomy with tumor resection was performed and appropriate chemotherapy was given to all the patients. The Kaplan-Meier survival method was used to calculate survival. The log-rank test was used to compare the groups with respect to survival. The age range was 1.25 to 15 years (median 4 years). Thirty-seven patients had only lung metastases, 12 had only liver metastases, 6 had both lung and liver metastases, 1 had adrenal gland metastases, and 1 had other site metastases. The overall survival rate in the whole group was 37.1%. The overall survival rates for lung and liver metastases were 50.2% and 16.6%, respectively. The overall survival rates were significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.005). Only one patient survived in the group with liver involvement. Liver involvement at diagnosis indicates a worse prognosis than lung involvement. Wilms' tumor patients with liver metastases should be treated with more intensive regimens than those with lung metastases.","15838388","VD","15838387","2"
"A gain-of-function mutation of JAK2 in myeloproliferative disorders.","2005","BACKGROUND. Polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and idiopathic myelofibrosis are clonal myeloproliferative disorders arising from a multipotent progenitor. The loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on the short arm of chromosome 9 (9pLOH) in myeloproliferative disorders suggests that 9p harbors a mutation that contributes to the cause of clonal expansion of hematopoietic cells in these diseases. METHODS. We performed microsatellite mapping of the 9pLOH region and DNA sequencing in 244 patients with myeloproliferative disorders (128 with polycythemia vera, 93 with essential thrombocythemia, and 23 with idiopathic myelofibrosis). RESULTS. Microsatellite mapping identified a 9pLOH region that included the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene. In patients with 9pLOH, JAK2 had a homozygous G-->T transversion, causing phenylalanine to be substituted for valine at position 617 of JAK2 (V617F). All 51 patients with 9pLOH had the V617F mutation. Of 193 patients without 9pLOH, 66 were heterozygous for V617F and 127 did not have the mutation. The frequency of V617F was 65 percent among patients with polycythemia vera (83 of 128), 57 percent among patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis (13 of 23), and 23 percent among patients with essential thrombocythemia (21 of 93). V617F is a somatic mutation present in hematopoietic cells. Mitotic recombination probably causes both 9pLOH and the transition from heterozygosity to homozygosity for V617F. Genetic evidence and in vitro functional studies indicate that V617F gives hematopoietic precursors proliferative and survival advantages. Patients with the V617F mutation had a significantly longer duration of disease and a higher rate of complications (fibrosis, hemorrhage, and thrombosis) and treatment with cytoreductive therapy than patients with wild-type JAK2. CONCLUSIONS. A high proportion of patients with myeloproliferative disorders carry a dominant gain-of-function mutation of JAK2.","15858187","IB","15858187","1"
"Host switch leads to emergence of Plasmodium vivax malaria in humans.","2005","The geographical origin of Plasmodium vivax, the most widespread human malaria parasite, is controversial. Although genetic closeness to Asian primate malarias has been confirmed by phylogenetic analyses, genetic similarities between P. vivax and Plasmodium simium, a New World primate malaria, suggest that humans may have acquired P. vivax from New World monkeys or vice versa. Additionally, the near fixation of the Duffy-negative blood type (FY x B(null)/FY x B(null)) in West and Central Africa, consistent with directional selection, and the association of Duffy negativity with complete resistance to vivax malaria suggest a prolonged period of host-parasite coevolution in Africa. Here we use Bayesian and likelihood methods in conjunction with cophylogeny mapping to reconstruct the genetic and coevolutionary history of P. vivax from the complete mitochondrial genome of 176 isolates as well as several closely related Plasmodium species. Taken together, a haplotype network, parasite migration patterns, demographic history, and cophylogeny mapping support an Asian origin via a host switch from macaque monkeys.","15858201","IB","15858187","2"
"Analysis of KIT mutations in sporadic and familial gastrointestinal stromal tumors: therapeutic implications through protein modeling.","2005","PURPOSE. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are characterized by expressing a gain-of-function mutation in KIT, and to a lesser extent, PDGFR. Imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has activity against GISTs that contain oncogenic mutations of KIT. In this study, KIT and PDGFRalpha mutation status was analyzed and protein modeling approaches were used to assess the potential effect of KIT mutations in response to imatinib therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. Genomic DNA was isolated from GIST tumors. Exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 of c-KIT and exons 12, 14, and 18 of PDGFRalpha were evaluated for oncogenic mutations. Protein modeling was used to assess mutations within the juxtamembrane region and the kinase domain of KIT. RESULTS. Mutations in KIT exons 9, 11, and 13 were identified in GISTs with the majority of changes involving the juxtamembrane region of KIT. Molecular modeling indicates that mutations in this region result in disruption of the KIT autoinhibited conformation, and lead to gain-of-function activation of the kinase. Furthermore, a novel germ-line mutation in KIT was identified that is associated with an autosomal dominant predisposition to the development of GIST. CONCLUSIONS. We have used protein modeling and structural analyses to elucidate why patients with GIST tumors containing exon 11 mutations are the most responsive to imatinib mesylate treatment. Importantly, mutations detected in this exon and others displayed constitutive activation of KIT. Furthermore, we have found tumors that are both KIT and PDGFRalpha mutation negative, suggesting that additional, yet unidentified, abnormalities may contribute to GIST tumorigenesis.","15897563","VD","15897563","1"
"Circulating tumor cells in breast cancer: correlation to bone marrow micrometastases, heterogeneous response to systemic therapy and low proliferative activity.","2005","PURPOSE. The incidence and biological characteristics of circulating tumor cells in the blood of patients with breast cancer were examined and subgroups were evaluated in the context of systemic treatment and the presence of disseminated tumor cells in bone marrow. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. Circulating tumor cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of patients with breast cancer using a gradient system designed for the enrichment of circulating tumor cells (OncoQuick). Circulating tumor cells were identified with the anti-cytokeratin antibody, A45-B/B3. In subsets of patients, expression of the proliferation-associated Ki-67 antigen in circulating tumor cells and the concomitant presence of micrometastases in bone marrow were examined. RESULTS. In patients with primary breast cancer (stage M(0)), circulating tumor cells were detected in 5 of 60 patients (8.3%) after surgery and before initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy; a positive correlation to the presence of disseminated tumor cells in bone marrow was observed (P = 0.030, n = 53). During the course of adjuvant chemotherapy, repeated analysis of 20 M(0) patients revealed the occurrence of circulating tumor cells in 7 of 16 patients that were initially negative. Patients with metastatic disease (stage M(1)) showed circulating tumor cells in 25 of 63 cases (39.7%, P < 0.0001 as compared with M(0) patients), and a positive finding was correlated with elevated concentrations of the serum tumor marker CA15.3 (P = 0.0093). Performing repeated analysis in a subgroup of 25 M(1) patients, circulating tumor cells were found more frequently in patients with progressive disease than in patients with stable disease or remission (87.5% versus 43.8% of patients with circulating tumor cells, respectively; P = 0.047). Independent of the disease-stage, none of the 47 patients examined for the proliferative status of their circulating tumor cells showed coexpression of Ki-67. CONCLUSIONS. Circulating tumor cells seem to be nonproliferating cells that persist during chemotherapy. Circulating tumor cell detection is linked to disease progression and elevated tumor marker concentrations in patients with metastatic breast cancer.","15897564","VD","15897563","2"
"Type and prevalence of BRAF mutations are closely associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma histotype and patients' age but not with tumour aggressiveness.","2005","A high prevalence of the BRAF(V600E) somatic mutation was recently reported in several series of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC). This mutation appears to be particularly prevalent in PTC with a predominantly papillary architecture. Another BRAF mutation (K601E) was detected in a follicular adenoma and in some cases of the follicular variant of PTC. The few studies on record provided controversial data on the relationship between the occurrence of BRAF mutations and clinicopathologic parameters such as gender, age and tumour staging. In an attempt to clarify such controversies we decided to enlarge our previous series to 315 tumours or tumour-like lesions diagnosed in 280 patients, including a thorough analysis of several clinicopathologic features. The BRAF(V600E) mutation was exclusively detected in PTC with a papillary or mixed follicular/papillary architecture both of the conventional type (46%) and of other histotypes, such as microcarcinoma (43%), Warthin-like PTC (75%) and oncocytic variant of PTC (55%). The BRAF(K601E) mutation was detected in four of the 54 cases of the follicular variant of PTC (7%). The mean age of patients with conventional PTC harbouring BRAF(V600E) (46.7 years) was significantly higher (P<0.0001) than that of patients with conventional PTC without BRAF(V600E) (29.5 years). The BRAF (BRAF(V600E)) mutated PTC did not exhibit signs of higher aggressiveness (size, vascular invasion, extra-thyroid extension and nodal metastasis) and were in fact less often multicentric than PTC without the mutation.","15902486","IVD","15902486","1"
"Cellular localisation of survivin: impact on the prognosis in colorectal cancer.","2005","PURPOSE. The present study was designed to determine whether the nuclear or cytoplasmic expression of survivin, was related to clinicopathological parameters and survival in sporadic colon carcinomas. METHODS. Western blotting of cell fractions and immunocytochemical methodology were used in five human colon cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemical study was performed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded section from 46 patients with sporadic colorectal adenocarcinomas with a polyclonal antibody directed against survivin. Apoptotic index was evaluated by using the M30 antibody. Survival rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Multivariate survival analysis was performed by the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS. Western blotting and immunocytochemistry analyses confirmed that survivin could be detected both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that 39% of tumours expressed survivin in the nucleus and 41% in the cytoplasm. No relationship was observed between survivin expression and clinicopathological features. Unexpectedly, the apoptotic index appeared to be linked with high survivin nuclear expression. Overall, 3-year observed survival rate was 73% in patients with cytoplasmic survivin expression versus 48% for negative expression (P = 0.14). Survival was 72% versus 50% for positive nuclear survivin expression versus negative (P = 0.16). After adjustment for age and stage, cytoplasmic survivin expression was a significant prognostic factor. A high level of expression was associated to a better survival: RR = 0.35 [0.13-0.98], P = 0.045. CONCLUSION. These results indicate that the analysis of the subcellular expression of survivin is a determining factor to define the prognostic value. Its evaluation, using a polyclonal antibody, might help clinicians in the stratification of patients with colorectal cancer.","15902487","IVD","15902486","2"
"PDGFRA mutations in gastrointestinal stromal tumors: frequency, spectrum and in vitro sensitivity to imatinib.","2005","PURPOSE. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) commonly harbor oncogenic mutations of the KIT tyrosine kinase, which is a target for the kinase inhibitor imatinib. A subset of GISTs, however, contains mutations in the homologous kinase platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), and the most common of these mutations is resistant to imatinib in vitro. Little is known of the other types of PDGFRA mutations that occur in GISTs. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We determined the KIT and PDGFRA mutation status of 1,105 unique GISTs using a combination of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing. RESULTS. 66 in exon 18, 11 in exon 12, and three in exon 14. Transient expression of representative PDGFRA isoforms in CHO cells revealed imatinib sensitivity of exon 12 mutations (SPDHE566-571R and insertion ER561-562) and an exon 14 substitution (N659K). However, most isoforms with a substitution involving codon D842 in exon 18 (D842V, RD841-842KI, DI842-843IM) were resistant to the drug, with the exception of D842Y. Interestingly, other mutations in exon 18 (D846Y, N848K, Y849K and HDSN845-848P) were all imatinib sensitive. Proliferation studies with BA/F3 cell lines stably expressing selected PDGFRA mutant isoforms supported these findings. CONCLUSION. Including our cases, there are 289 reported PDGFRA-mutant GISTs, of which 181 (62.6%) had the imatinib-resistant substitution D842V. However, our findings suggest that more than one third of GISTs with PDGFRA mutations may respond to imatinib and that mutation screening may be helpful in the management of these tumors.","15928335","VD","15928335","1"
"Outpatient Osteopathic SOAP Note Form: preliminary results in osteopathic outcomes-based research.","2005","One of the persistent challenges facing the osteopathic medical profession has been the lack of a reliable, easy-to-use, validated system for recording, collecting, and evaluating clinical findings in a format that is suitable for long-term data collection. As a result of the recent emphasis on outcomes-based research in the field of medicine, the creation and use of a standardized tool for the osteopathic profession has been pursued with increased urgency. In this study, the authors used participant-completed and previously validated Outpatient Osteopathic SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) Note Forms (SNFs) and Outpatient Osteopathic SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) Note--Follow-up Forms to obtain answers to 17 outcomes-based questions that the profession must address to meet the new challenges and demands of outcomes-based research. A consortium of 10 osteopathic physicians and 196 osteopathic residents and undergraduate fellows submitted a total of 3908 patient SNFs for analysis. Answers to these 17 questions were computed using appropriate statistical determinants (eg, frequencies, correlations). Retrospective analysis indicated that, in addition to the outcomes addressed in this study, use of the SNF could be extended to the following functions: pre- and postdoctoral tracking, outcomes research into the efficacy of osteopathic intervention, medical science research, autonomic correlation with disease entities, etiology of musculoskeletal dysfunction, billing information, and internal comparison studies between osteopathic physicians. A long-term goal of the SNF project is to create an electronic national database for osteopathic outcomes-based research.","15928337","VD","15928335","2"
"In vitro activity of Bcr-Abl inhibitors AMN107 and BMS-354825 against clinically relevant imatinib-resistant Abl kinase domain mutants.","2005","Imatinib, a Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is a highly effective therapy for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Despite durable responses in most chronic phase patients, relapses have been observed and are much more prevalent in patients with advanced disease. The most common mechanism of acquired imatinib resistance has been traced to Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutations with decreased imatinib sensitivity. Thus, alternate Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors that have activity against imatinib-resistant mutants would be useful for patients who relapse on imatinib therapy. Two such Bcr-Abl inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials: the improved potency, selective Abl inhibitor AMN107 and the highly potent dual Src/Abl inhibitor BMS-354825. In the current article, we compared imatinib, AMN107, and BMS-354825 in cellular and biochemical assays against a panel of 16 kinase domain mutants representing >90% of clinical isolates. We report that AMN107 and BMS-354825 are 20-fold and 325-fold more potent than imatinib against cells expressing wild-type Bcr-Abl and that similar improvements are maintained for all imatinib-resistant mutants tested, with the exception of T315I. Thus, both inhibitors hold promise for treating imatinib-refractory CML.","15930265","VD","15930265","1"
"A mouse model for the Carney complex tumor syndrome develops neoplasia in cyclic AMP-responsive tissues.","2005","Carney complex is an autosomal dominant neoplasia syndrome characterized by spotty skin pigmentation, myxomatosis, endocrine tumors, and schwannomas. This condition may be caused by inactivating mutations in PRKAR1A, the gene encoding the type 1A regulatory subunit of protein kinase A. To better understand the mechanism by which PRKAR1A mutations cause disease, we have developed conventional and conditional null alleles for Prkar1a in the mouse. Prkar1a(+/-) mice developed nonpigmented schwannomas and fibro-osseous bone lesions beginning at approximately 6 months of age. Although genotype-specific cardiac and adrenal lesions were not seen, benign and malignant thyroid neoplasias were observed in older mice. This spectrum of tumors overlaps that seen in Carney complex patients, confirming the validity of this mouse model. Genetic analysis indicated that allelic loss occurred in a subset of tumor cells, suggesting that complete loss of Prkar1a plays a key role in tumorigenesis. Similarly, tissue-specific ablation of Prkar1a from a subset of facial neural crest cells caused the formation of schwannomas with divergent differentiation. These observations confirm the identity of PRKAR1A as a tumor suppressor gene with specific importance to cyclic AMP-responsive tissues and suggest that these mice may be valuable tools not only for understanding endocrine tumorigenesis but also for understanding inherited predispositions for schwannoma formation.","15930266","VD","15930265","2"
"Functional analysis of PIK3CA gene mutations in human colorectal cancer.","2005","Mutations in the PIK3CA gene, which encodes the p110alpha catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), have been reported in human cancers, including colorectal cancer. Most of the mutations cluster at hotspots within the helical and kinase domains. Whereas H1047R, one of the hotspot mutants, is reported to have elevated lipid kinase activity, the functional consequences of other mutations have not been examined. In this study, we examined the effects of colon cancer-associated PIK3CA mutations on the lipid kinase activity in vitro, activation of the downstream targets Akt and p70S6K in vivo and NIH 3T3-transforming ability. Of eight mutations examined, all showed increased lipid kinase activity compared with wild-type p110alpha. All the mutants strongly activated Akt and p70S6K compared with wild-type p110alpha as determined by immunoblotting using phospho-specific antibodies. These mutants also induced morphologic changes, loss of contact inhibition, and anchorage-independent growth of NIH 3T3 cells. The hotspot mutations examined in this study, E542K, E545K, and H1047R, all had high enzymatic and transforming activities. These results show that almost all the colon cancer-associated PIK3CA mutations are functionally active so that they are likely to be involved in carcinogenesis.","15930273","IVD","15930273","1"
"Liver-specific pRB loss results in ectopic cell cycle entry and aberrant ploidy.","2005","The liver exhibits an exquisitely controlled cell cycle, wherein hepatocytes are maintained in quiescence until stimulated to proliferate. The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor, pRB, plays a central role in proliferative control by inhibiting inappropriate cell cycle entry. In many cases, liver cancer arises due to aberrant cycles of proliferation, and correspondingly, pRB is functionally inactivated in the majority of hepatocellular carcinomas. Therefore, to determine how pRB loss may provide conditions permissive for deregulated hepatocyte proliferation, we investigated the consequence of somatic pRB inactivation in murine liver. We show that liver-specific pRB loss results in E2F target gene deregulation and elevated cell cycle progression during post-natal growth. However, in adult livers, E2F targets are repressed and hepatocytes become quiescent independent of pRB, suggesting that other factors may compensate for pRB loss. Therefore, to probe the consequences of acute pRB inactivation in livers of adult mice, we gave adenoviral-Cre by i.v. injection. We show that acute pRB loss is sufficient to elicit E2F target gene expression and cell cycle entry in adult liver, demonstrating a critical role for pRB in maintaining hepatocyte quiescence. Finally, we show that liver-specific pRB loss results in the development of nuclear pleomorphism associated with elevated ploidy that is evident in adult mice harboring both acute and chronic pRB loss. Together, these results show the crucial role played by pRB in maintaining hepatocyte quiescence and ploidy in adult liver in vivo and underscore the critical importance of delineating the consequences of acute pRB loss in adult animals.","15930274","IVD","15930273","2"

"A new BRAF gene mutation detected in a case of a solid variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma.","2005","BRAF gene mutations have been frequently detected in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Moreover, there is a close association between the type of mutation and the PTC histotype: BRAF(V600E) is associated with conventional PTC and with histological variants of PTC displaying a prominent papillary growth pattern, whereas BRAF(K601E) is associated with the follicular variant of PTC. We report the detection of a novel BRAF triplet deletion in a case of PTC displaying a predominantly solid growth pattern. The deletion leads to the replacement of a valine and a lysine by a glutamate in the BRAF activation segment (BRAF(VK600-1E)), thus mimicking partially the 2 BRAF mutations previously described. Our study reinforces the existence of a close relationship between the occurrence of some types of BRAF mutation and some PTC histotypes. The genetic study of more cases of the solid variant of PTC is necessary to find whether there exists a significant association between the occurrence of BRAF(VK600-1E) and such PTC histotype.","16021577","IVD","16021577","1"
"Mucinous carcinoma (poorly differentiated carcinoma with extensive extracellular mucin deposition) of the thyroid: a case report with immunohistochemical studies.","2005","We report on a case of mucinous carcinoma of the thyroid in an 82-year-old Japanese woman. The 3 x 2 x 2-cm thyroid tumor located in the patient's right lateral lobe was soft and yellowish gray on the cut section. Microscopically, the tumor was composed entirely of strands or solid clusters accompanied by extensive extracellular mucin. Extracellular mucin was positive with Alcian blue stain and negative with periodic acid-Schiff stain. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for thyroglobulin, thyroid-specific transcription factor 1, and low-molecular-weight cytokeratin but negative for carcinoembryonic antigen, calcitonin, and high-molecular-weight cytokeratin. The MIB-1 labeling index was rather high (11%), and immunoexpression of p53 was detectable in the nuclei of carcinoma cells. From these findings, we classified the present tumor as a mucinous carcinoma of the thyroid (poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma producing massive extracellular mucin). The patient died of multiple metastases 4 years after the initial operation.","16021578","IVD","16021577","2"
"Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor and in KRAS are predictive and prognostic indicators in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer treated with chemotherapy alone and in combination with erlotinib.","2005","PURPOSE. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations have been associated with tumor response to treatment with single-agent EGFR inhibitors in patients with relapsed non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The implications of EGFR mutations in patients treated with EGFR inhibitors plus first-line chemotherapy are unknown. KRAS is frequently activated in NSCLC. The relationship of KRAS mutations to outcome after EGFR inhibitor treatment has not been described. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Previously untreated patients with advanced NSCLC in the phase III TRIBUTE study who were randomly assigned to carboplatin and paclitaxel with erlotinib or placebo were assessed for survival, response, and time to progression (TTP). EGFR exons 18 through 21 and KRAS exon 2 were sequenced in tumors from 274 patients. Outcomes were correlated with EGFR and KRAS mutations in retrospective subset analyses. RESULTS. EGFR mutations were detected in 13% of tumors and were associated with longer survival, irrespective of treatment (P < .001). Among erlotinib-treated patients, EGFR mutations were associated with improved response rate (P < .05) and there was a trend toward an erlotinib benefit on TTP (P = .092), but not improved survival (P = .96). KRAS mutations (21% of tumors) were associated with significantly decreased TTP and survival in erlotinib plus chemotherapy-treated patients. CONCLUSION. EGFR mutations may be a positive prognostic factor for survival in advanced NSCLC patients treated with chemotherapy with or without erlotinib, and may predict greater likelihood of response.

"Inhibition of drug-resistant mutants of ABL, KIT, and EGF receptor kinases.","2005","To realize the full potential of targeted protein kinase inhibitors for the treatment of cancer, it is important to address the emergence of drug resistance in treated patients. Mutant forms of BCR-ABL, KIT, and the EGF receptor (EGFR) have been found that confer resistance to the drugs imatinib, gefitinib, and erlotinib. The mutations weaken or prevent drug binding, and interestingly, one of the most common sites of mutation in all three kinases is a highly conserved ""gatekeeper"" threonine residue near the kinase active site. We have identified existing clinical compounds that bind and inhibit drug-resistant mutant variants of ABL, KIT, and EGFR. We found that the Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 and the p38 inhibitor BIRB-796 inhibit the imatinib- and BMS-354825-resistant ABL(T315I) kinase. The KIT/FLT3 inhibitor SU-11248 potently inhibits the imatinib-resistant KIT(V559D/T670I) kinase, consistent with the clinical efficacy of SU-11248 against imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal tumors, and the EGFR inhibitors EKB-569 and CI-1033, but not GW-572016 and ZD-6474, potently inhibit the gefitinib- and erlotinib-resistant EGFR(L858R/T790M) kinase. EKB-569 and CI-1033 are already in clinical trials, and our results suggest that they should be considered for testing in the treatment of gefitinib/erlotinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer. The results highlight the strategy of screening existing clinical compounds against newly identified drug-resistant mutant variants to find compounds that may serve as starting points for the development of next-generation drugs, or that could be used directly to treat patients that have acquired resistance to first-generation targeted therapy.","16046538","VD","16046538","1"
"NK cytotoxicity against CD4+ T cells during HIV-1 infection: a gp41 peptide induces the expression of an NKp44 ligand.","2005","HIV infection leads to a state of chronic immune activation and progressive deterioration in immune function, manifested most recognizably by the progressive depletion of CD4+ T cells. A substantial percentage of natural killer (NK) cells from patients with HIV infection are activated and express the natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR) NKp44. Here we show that a cellular ligand for NKp44 (NKp44L) is expressed during HIV-1 infection and is correlated with both the progression of CD4+ T cell depletion and the increase of viral load. CD4+ T cells expressing this ligand are highly sensitive to the NK lysis activity mediated by NKp44+ NK cells. The expression of NKp44L is induced by the linear motif NH2-SWSNKS-COOH of the HIV-1 envelope gp41 protein. This highly conserved motif appears critical to the sharp increase in NK lysis of CD4+ T cells from HIV-infected patients. These studies strongly suggest that induction of NKp44L plays a key role in the lysis of CD4+ T cells by activated NK cells in HIV infection and consequently provide a framework for considering how HIV-1 may use NK cell immune surveillance to trigger CD4+ T cells. Understanding this mechanism may help to develop future therapeutic strategies and vaccines against HIV-1 infection.","16046540","VD","16046538","2"
"Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene are linked to smoking-independent, lung adenocarcinoma.","2005","Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are a potential predictor of the effectiveness of EGFR inhibitors for the treatment of lung cancer. Although EGFR mutations were reported to occur with high frequency in nonsmoking Japanese adenocarcinoma patients, the exact nature has not been fully elucidated. We examined EGFR gene mutations within exons 18-21 and their correlations to clinico-pathological factors and other genetic alterations in tumour specimens from 154 patients who underwent resection for lung cancer at Kyoto University Hospital. Epidermal growth factor receptor mutations were observed in 60 tumours (39.0%), all of which were adenocarcinoma. Among the patients with adenocarcinoma (n=108), EGFR mutations were more frequently observed in nonsmokers than former smokers or current smokers (83.0, 50.0, 15.2%, respectively), in women than men (76.3 vs 34.0%), in tumours with bronchio-alveolar component than those without bronchio-alveolar component (78.9 vs 42.9%), and in well or moderately differentiated tumours than poorly differentiated tumours (72.0, 64.4, 34.2%). No tumours with EGFR mutations had any K-ras codon 12 mutations, which were well-known smoking-related gene mutations. In conclusion, adenocarcinomas with EGFR mutation had a distinctive clinico-pathological feature unrelated to smoking. Epidermal growth factor receptor mutations may play a key role in the development of smoking-independent adenocarcinoma.","16052218","IVD","16052218","1"

To explore the prognostic value of mutations in c-KIT and PDGFR-alpha genes with respect to relapse-free survival (RFS) in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). We have investigated the prognostic relevance of the type and position of the mutations, in addition to other clinicopathologic factors, in a large series of patients with GIST. METHODS. For this study, 162 patients were selected according to the following criteria: completely resected tumors with negative margins attended between 1994 and 2001; no metastasis at diagnosis; tumor larger than 2 cm, c-KIT-positive immunostaining; and no other primary tumors. RESULTS. The median follow-up was 42 months for patients free of recurrence. Mutations were detected in 96 tumors (60%): 82 cases involving c-KIT and 14 cases involving PDFGR-alpha. Univariate analysis demonstrated the following as poor prognostic factors for RFS: tumors larger than 10 cm (P < .0001); mitotic count higher than 10 mitoses per 50 high-power fields (P < .0001); high risk index (P < .0001); intestinal GIST location (P = .0041); high cellularity (P < .0001); tumor necrosis (P < .0001); deletions affecting exon 11 (P = .0007); and deletions affecting codons 557 to 558 (P < .0001). After the multivariate analysis, only the high risk index (relative risk [RR], 12.36), high cellularity (RR, 3.97), and deletions affecting codons 557 to 558 of c-KIT (RR, 2.57) corresponded to independent prognostic factors for RFS in GIST patients. CONCLUSION. Deletions affecting codons 557 to 558 are relevant for the prognosis of RFS in GIST patients. This critical genetic alteration should be considered to be a new prognostic stratification variable for randomized trials exploring imatinib mesylate in the adjuvant setting in GIST patients.","16135486","IIIC","16135486","1"
"Late side effects of short-course preoperative radiotherapy combined with total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer: increased bowel dysfunction in irradiated patients--a Dutch colorectal cancer group study.","2005","PURPOSE. Preoperative short-term radiotherapy improves local control in patients treated with total mesorectal excision (TME). This study was performed to assess the presence and magnitude of long-term side effects of preoperative 5 x 5 Gy radiotherapy and TME. Also, hospital treatment was recorded for diseases possibly related to late side effects of rectal cancer treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Long-term morbidity was assessed in patients from the prospective randomized TME trial, which investigated the efficacy of 5 x 5 Gy before TME surgery for mobile rectal cancer. Dutch patients without recurrent disease were sent a questionnaire. RESULTS. Results were obtained from 597 patients, with a median follow-up of 5.1 years. Stoma function, urinary function, and hospital treatment rates did not differ significantly between the treatment arms. However, irradiated patients, compared with nonirradiated patients, reported increased rates of fecal incontinence (62% v 38%, respectively; P < .001), pad wearing as a result of incontinence (56% v 33%, respectively; P < .001), anal blood loss (11% v 3%, respectively; P = .004), and mucus loss (27% v 15%, respectively; P = .005). Satisfaction with bowel function was significantly lower and the impact of bowel dysfunction on daily activities was greater in irradiated patients compared with patients who underwent TME alone. CONCLUSION. Although preoperative short-term radiotherapy for rectal cancer results in increased local control, there is more long-term bowel dysfunction in irradiated patients than in patients who undergo TME alone. Rectal cancer patients should be informed on late morbidity of both radiotherapy and TME. Future strategies should be aimed at selecting patients for radiotherapy who are at high risk for local failure.","16135487","IIIC","16135486","2"

For this study, 162 patients were selected according to the following criteria: completely resected tumors with negative margins attended between 1994 and 2001; no metastasis at diagnosis; tumor larger than 2 cm, c-KIT-positive immunostaining; and no other primary tumors. RESULTS. The median follow-up was 42 months for patients free of recurrence. Mutations were detected in 96 tumors (60%): 82 cases involving c-KIT and 14 cases involving PDFGR-alpha. Univariate analysis demonstrated the following as poor prognostic factors for RFS: tumors larger than 10 cm (P < .0001); mitotic count higher than 10 mitoses per 50 high-power fields (P < .0001); high risk index (P < .0001); intestinal GIST location (P = .0041); high cellularity (P < .0001); tumor necrosis (P < .0001); deletions affecting exon 11 (P = .0007); and deletions affecting codons 557 to 558 (P < .0001). After the multivariate analysis, only the high risk index (relative risk [RR], 12.36), high cellularity (RR, 3.97), and deletions affecting codons 557 to 558 of c-KIT (RR, 2.57) corresponded to independent prognostic factors for RFS in GIST patients. CONCLUSION. Deletions affecting codons 557 to 558 are relevant for the prognosis of RFS in GIST patients. This critical genetic alteration should be considered to be a new prognostic stratification variable for randomized trials exploring imatinib mesylate in the adjuvant setting in GIST patients.","16135486","IVD","16135486","1"
"Late side effects of short-course preoperative radiotherapy combined with total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer: increased bowel dysfunction in irradiated patients--a Dutch colorectal cancer group study.","2005","PURPOSE. Preoperative short-term radiotherapy improves local control in patients treated with total mesorectal excision (TME). This study was performed to assess the presence and magnitude of long-term side effects of preoperative 5 x 5 Gy radiotherapy and TME. Also, hospital treatment was recorded for diseases possibly related to late side effects of rectal cancer treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Long-term morbidity was assessed in patients from the prospective randomized TME trial, which investigated the efficacy of 5 x 5 Gy before TME surgery for mobile rectal cancer. Dutch patients without recurrent disease were sent a questionnaire. RESULTS. Results were obtained from 597 patients, with a median follow-up of 5.1 years. Stoma function, urinary function, and hospital treatment rates did not differ significantly between the treatment arms. However, irradiated patients, compared with nonirradiated patients, reported increased rates of fecal incontinence (62% v 38%, respectively; P < .001), pad wearing as a result of incontinence (56% v 33%, respectively; P < .001), anal blood loss (11% v 3%, respectively; P = .004), and mucus loss (27% v 15%, respectively; P = .005). Satisfaction with bowel function was significantly lower and the impact of bowel dysfunction on daily activities was greater in irradiated patients compared with patients who underwent TME alone. CONCLUSION. Although preoperative short-term radiotherapy for rectal cancer results in increased local control, there is more long-term bowel dysfunction in irradiated patients than in patients who undergo TME alone. Rectal cancer patients should be informed on late morbidity of both radiotherapy and TME. Future strategies should be aimed at selecting patients for radiotherapy who are at high risk for local failure.","16135487","IVD","16135486","2"
"Oncogenic transformation by inhibitor-sensitive and -resistant EGFR mutants.","2005","BACKGROUND. Somatic mutations in the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase gene EGFR are common in lung adenocarcinoma. The presence of mutations correlates with tumor sensitivity to the EGFR inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib, but the transforming potential of specific mutations and their relationship to drug sensitivity have not been described. METHODS AND FINDINGS. Here, we demonstrate that EGFR active site mutants are oncogenic. Mutant EGFR can transform both fibroblasts and lung epithelial cells in the absence of exogenous epidermal growth factor, as evidenced by anchorage-independent growth, focus formation, and tumor formation in immunocompromised mice. Transformation is associated with constitutive autophosphorylation of EGFR, Shc phosphorylation, and STAT pathway activation. Whereas transformation by most EGFR mutants confers on cells sensitivity to erlotinib and gefitinib, transformation by an exon 20 insertion makes cells resistant to these inhibitors but more sensitive to the irreversible inhibitor CL-387,785. CONCLUSION. Oncogenic transformation of cells by different EGFR mutants causes differential sensitivity to gefitinib and erlotinib. Treatment of lung cancers harboring EGFR exon 20 insertions may therefore require the development of alternative kinase inhibition strategies.","16187797","VD","16187797","1"
"Effect of artemether-lumefantrine policy and improved vector control on malaria burden in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.","2005","BACKGROUND. Between 1995 and 2000, KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, experienced a marked increase in Plasmodium falciparum malaria, fuelled by pyrethroid and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance. In response, vector control was strengthened and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) was deployed in the first Ministry of Health artemisinin-based combination treatment policy in Africa. In South Africa, effective vector and parasite control had historically ensured low-intensity malaria transmission. Malaria is diagnosed definitively and treatment is provided free of charge in reasonably accessible public-sector health-care facilities. METHODS AND FINDINGS. We reviewed four years of malaria morbidity and mortality data at four sentinel health-care facilities within KwaZulu-Natal's malaria-endemic area. In the year following improved vector control and implementation of AL treatment, malaria-related admissions and deaths both declined by 89%, and outpatient visits decreased by 85% at the sentinel facilities. By 2003, malaria-related outpatient cases and admissions had fallen by 99%, and malaria-related deaths had decreased by 97%. There was a concomitant marked and sustained decline in notified malaria throughout the province. No serious adverse events were associated causally with AL treatment in an active sentinel pharmacovigilance survey. In a prospective study with 42 d follow up, AL cured 97/98 (99%) and prevented gametocyte developing in all patients. Consistent with the findings of focus group discussions, a household survey found self-reported adherence to the six-dose AL regimen was 96%. CONCLUSION. Together with concurrent strengthening of vector control measures, the antimalarial treatment policy change to AL in KwaZulu-Natal contributed to a marked and sustained decrease in malaria cases, admissions, and deaths, by greatly improving clinical and parasitological cure rates and reducing gametocyte carriage.","16187798","VD","16187797","2"
"Distinctive activation patterns in constitutively active and gefitinib-sensitive EGFR mutants.","2006","Mutations in the kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are associated with clinical responsiveness to gefitinib in patients with non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Recently, we have identified many novel EGFR mutations in NSCLC tissues. In this study, we found that gefitinib could suppress the tyrosine phosphorylation of most EGFR mutants better than the wild-type receptor. However, gefitinib had quite variable growth-suppressive effects on different EGFR mutant-expressing cells. All tested EGFR mutants have high basal phosphorylation at multiple tyrosine residues. Upon EGF stimulation, the mutated EGFRs did not have apparently stronger phosphorylation at tyrosines 845, 992, 1,068, and 1,173 than the wild-type receptor. However, stronger phosphorylation at tyrosine 1,045 was observed in the S768I, L861Q, E709G, and G719S mutants. The E746-A750 deletion mutant was less responsive to EGF than the wild-type and other mutant receptors. The S768I, L861Q, E709G, and G719S mutants were refractory to EGF-induced ubiquitination and had more sustained tyrosine phosphorylation. E709G and G719S also lacked EGF-induced receptor downregulation. Our results indicate that, in addition to sensitivity to gefitinib, EGFR mutations also caused various changes in EGFR's regulatory mechanisms, which may contribute to the constitutive activation of EGFR mutants and oncogenesis in NSCLC.","16205628","IVD","16205628","1"
"Small regions of overlapping deletions on 6q26 in human astrocytic tumours identified using chromosome 6 tile path array-CGH.","2006","Deletions of chromosome 6 are a common abnormality in diverse human malignancies including astrocytic tumours, suggesting the presence of tumour suppressor genes (TSG). In order to help identify candidate TSGs, we have constructed a chromosome 6 tile path microarray. The array contains 1,780 clones (778 P1-derived artificial chromosome and 1,002 bacterial artificial chromosome) that cover 98.3% of the published chromosome 6 sequences. A total of 104 adult astrocytic tumours (10 diffuse astrocytomas, 30 anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), 64 glioblastomas (GB)) were analysed using this array. Single copy number change was successfully detected and the result was in general concordant with a microsatellite analysis. The pattern of copy number change was complex with multiple interstitial deletions/gains. However, a predominance of telomeric 6q deletions was seen. Two small common and overlapping regions of deletion at 6q26 were identified. One was 1,002 kb in size and contained PACRG and QKI, while the second was 199 kb and harbours a single gene, ARID1B. The data show that the chromosome 6 tile path array is useful in mapping copy number changes with high resolution and accuracy. We confirmed the high frequency of chromosome 6 deletions in AA and GB, and identified two novel commonly deleted regions that may harbour TSGs.","16205629","IVD","16205628","2"
"KIT mutations, and not FLT3 internal tandem duplication, are strongly associated with a poor prognosis in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia with t(8;21): a study of the Japanese Childhood AML Cooperative Study Group.","2006","Patients with t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are considered to have a good prognosis; however, approximately 50% of them relapse. The genetic alterations associated with a poor outcome in t(8;21) AML remain unknown. Recently, aberrations of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) were frequently found in patients with AML. However, the prevalence and prognostic impact of RTK aberrations in pediatric t(8;21) AML remains undetermined. Here, we found the kinase domain mutations of the KIT gene in 8 (17.4%) of 46 patients with t(8;21) AML among newly diagnosed pediatric patients with AML treated on the AML99 protocol in Japan. Significant differences between patients with or without KIT mutations were observed in the 4-year overall survival (50.0% versus 97.4%, P = .001), disease-free survival (37.5% versus 94.7%, P < .001) and relapse rate (47.0% versus 2.7%, P < .001). Furthermore, FLT3 internal tandem duplication was found in only 2 (4.3%) patients. These results suggested that KIT mutations are strongly associated with a poor prognosis in pediatric t(8;21) AML.","16291592","IVD","16291592","1"
"Recent insights into the role of Notch signaling in tumorigenesis.","2006","Members of the Notch family of transmembrane receptors play an important role in cell fate determination. Over the past decade, a role for Notch in the pathogenesis of hematologic and solid malignancies has become apparent. Numerous cellular functions and microenvironmental cues associated with tumorigenesis are modulated by Notch signaling, including proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and angiogenesis. It is becoming increasingly evident that Notch signaling can be both oncogenic and tumor suppressive. This review highlights recent findings regarding the molecular and functional aspects of Notch-mediated neoplastic transformation. In addition, cellular mechanisms that potentially explain the complex role of Notch in tumorigenesis are discussed.","16291593","IVD","16291592","2"
"The oncogenic properties of mutant p110alpha and p110beta phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases in human mammary epithelial cells.","2005","The PIK3CA gene encoding the p110alpha subunit of Class IA phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) is frequently mutated in human tumors. Mutations in the PIK3CB gene encoding p110beta, the only other widely expressed Class IA PI3K, have not been reported. We compared the biochemical activity and transforming potential of mutant forms of p110alpha and p110beta in a human mammary epithelial cell system. The two most common tumor-derived alleles of p110alpha, H1047R and E545K, potently activated PI3K signaling. Human mammary epithelial cells expressing these alleles grew efficiently in soft agar and as orthotopic tumors in nude mice. We also examined a third class of mutations in p110alpha, those in the p85-binding domain. A representative tumor-derived p85-binding-domain mutant R38H showed modestly reduced p85 binding and weakly activated PI3K/Akt signaling. In contrast, a deletion mutant lacking the entire p85-binding domain efficiently activated PI3K signaling. When we constructed in p110beta a mutation homologous to the E545K allele of p110alpha, the resulting p110beta mutant was only weakly activated and allowed minimal soft-agar growth. However, a gene fusion of p110beta with the membrane anchor from c-Src was highly active and transforming in both soft-agar and orthotopic nude mouse assays. Thus, although introduction of activating mutations from p110alpha at the corresponding sites in p110beta failed to render the enzyme oncogenic in human cells, the possibility remains that other mutations might activate the beta isoform.","16339315","VD","16339315","1"
"Auditory-visual fusion in speech perception in children with cochlear implants.","2005","Speech, for most of us, is a bimodal percept whenever we both hear the voice and see the lip movements of a speaker. Children who are born deaf never have this bimodal experience. We tested children who had been deaf from birth and who subsequently received cochlear implants for their ability to fuse the auditory information provided by their implants with visual information about lip movements for speech perception. For most of the children with implants (92%), perception was dominated by vision when visual and auditory speech information conflicted. For some, bimodal fusion was strong and consistent, demonstrating a remarkable plasticity in their ability to form auditory-visual associations despite the atypical stimulation provided by implants. The likelihood of consistent auditory-visual fusion declined with age at implant beyond 2.5 years, suggesting a sensitive period for bimodal integration in speech perception.","16339316","VD","16339315","2"
"Deletion of the KIT gene is associated with liver metastasis and poor prognosis in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor in the stomach.","2006","The goal of this study was to investigate the association of mutations in the KIT gene and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) gene with clinicopathological features of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) localized in the stomach. We evaluated 56 gastric GISTs for KIT and PDGFRA mutations. DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tumor specimens, and exons 9, 11, 13 and 17 of the KIT gene and exons 12 and 18 of the PDGFRA gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The genetic features were then compared with the clinicopathological features. Immunohistochemistry was performed for KIT, CD34, Ki-67 (as a marker of cell proliferation) and CD31 (as a marker of microvessel density), and apoptosis was assessed by in situ DNA nick-end labeling. Thirty-four (61%) of the 56 GISTs had a mutation in exon 11 of KIT, and 2 (4%) had a mutation in exon 13 of KIT. Deletions in exon 11 of KIT were the most common mutation encountered in the present study. No mutations were found in exon 9 or 17 of KIT. Six of the 20 GISTs lacking KIT mutations had a mutation in exon 18 of PDGFRA, and 1 had a mutation in exon 12 of PDGFRA. The KIT mutation-positive GISTs showed more frequent liver metastases and higher mortality than KIT mutation-negative GISTs. Our data indicate that KIT mutations, especially deletions in exon 11, are markers of poor prognosis for gastric GISTs.","16685437","IVD","16685437","1"
"Poor outcome of patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma showing decreased E-cadherin combined with increased S100A4 expression.","2006","A loss or reduced expression of E-cadherin, the main cell-to-cell adhesion molecule, correlates with distant metastasis in various cancers. Recent studies have reported a close correlation between the expression of E-cadherin and that of S100A4, calcium-binding protein. In this study, we investigated the expression of E-cadherin and S100A4 status in relation to the clinicopathological parameters of pulmonary adenocarcinoma. We finely and quantitatively examined the expression of E-cadherin and S100A4 using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a total of 92 pulmonary adenocarcinomas obtained by surgical resection. All of the pulmonary adenocarcinomas showed significant expression of E-cadherin and S100A4. Real-time PCR showed lower E-cadherin expression in 21 adenocarcinomas, while 71 adenocarcinomas expressed a higher expression of E-cadherin. Of 21 adenocarcinomas with lower-expressing E-cadherin, 12 showed a higher expression of S100A4. These 12 cases significantly showed a poorer prognosis than others (p=0.047, Kaplan-Meier, log-rank test) and significantly showed more frequent venous involvement than others (p=0.042, chi2 test). These results suggested that reduced E-cadherin expression combined with higher S100A4 expression is related to a poor prognosis through hematogenous metastasis in pulmonary adenocarcinoma.","16685438","IVD","16685437","2"
"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors with KIT exon 11 deletions are associated with poor prognosis.","2006","BACKGROUND & AIMS. Gain-of-function mutations in the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase gene and rare mutations in the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) gene are important events in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) development. Different mutations are reportedly associated with distinctive phenotypes and possibly clinical behavior. We investigated the correlation among mutation type, phenotype, and clinical course in a preimatinib, population-based series of GIST with long-term follow-up. METHODS. Genomic DNA from 177 GIST patients was analyzed for KIT exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 and PDGFRA exons 12 and 18 mutations using denaturating high-performance liquid chromatography and bidirectional sequencing. RESULTS. KIT exon 11 mutations were detected in 101 of 177 GIST (61 deletions, 23 missense mutations, and 17 duplications); wild-type (WT) KIT and PDGFRA were detected in 63; KIT exon 9 and exon 17 mutations in 6 and 1, respectively; and PDGFRA exons 12 and 18 mutations in 3 each. GIST >5 cm vs GIST </=1 cm had mutations in 73% and 33%, respectively. KIT exon 11 deletions were significantly associated with a higher proportion of high risk or overtly malignant groups compared with WT GIST. KIT exon 11 deletions adversely affected outcome. KIT exon 11 duplications and exon 9 mutations were found exclusively in gastric and small intestinal GIST, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. KIT exon 11 deletion is an independent adverse prognostic factor in patients with GIST.","16697720","IVD","16697720","1"
"Surface visualization at 3D endoluminal CT colonography: degree of coverage and implications for polyp detection.","2006","BACKGROUND & AIMS. Effective colonoscopic screening for polyps, whether by optical or virtual means, requires adequate visualization of the entire colonic surface. The purpose of this study was to assess prospectively the degree of surface coverage at 3-dimensional (3D) endoluminal computed tomography colonography (CTC) after retrograde fly-through, combined retrograde-antegrade fly-through, and review of remaining missed regions. METHODS. The study group consisted of 223 asymptomatic adults (mean age, 57.8 +/- 7.2 y; 111 men, 112 women) undergoing primary CTC screening. CTC studies were interpreted by experienced readers using a primary 3D approach. The CTC software system that was used continually tracks the percentage of endoluminal surface visualized. The degree of coverage was assessed prospectively after retrograde and combined retrograde-antegrade navigation. The added effect of reviewing missed regions was also assessed prospectively. RESULTS. The mean surface coverage after only retrograde 3D endoluminal fly-through from rectum to cecum was 76.6% +/- 4.8% (range, 63%-92%); coverage was 80% or less in 181 (81.2%) patients. Antegrade navigation back to the rectum increased the overall coverage to 94.1% +/- 2.3% (range, 84%-99%; P < .0001). A review of missed regions 300 mm(2) or larger increased coverage to 97.9% +/- 1.1% (range, 93%-99%; P < .0001) and added 21.4 +/- 11.4 seconds to the interpretation time (range, 3-67 s). CONCLUSIONS. Combined bidirectional retrograde and antegrade 3D navigation, supplemented by rapid review of missed regions, effectively covers the entire evaluable surface at CTC. Unidirectional retrograde 3D fly-through typically excludes 20% or more of the endoluminal surface, which may provide insight into potential limitations at optical colonoscopy.","16697721","IVD","16697720","2"
"Detection of c-kit exons 11- and 17-activating mutations in testicular seminomas by high-resolution melting amplicon analysis.","2006","A subgroup of testicular seminomas has been reported to contain activating mutations in KIT, the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor encoded by the c-kit gene. Most mutations are in exon 17, although exon 11-activating mutations have recently been described. For patients refractory to standard therapeutic protocols for seminoma, the presence of c-kit-activating mutations in some of these neoplasms might suggest an alternative therapy with KIT targeting drugs. We used the novel mutation scanning technique, high-resolution melting amplicon analysis, to screen a series of 22 testicular seminomas for c-kit-activating mutations. Four cases (18%) had exon 17-activating mutations and these included D816Y, D816V, Y823N and one case that contained both D816E and D820H. A single case (5%) had an exon 11-activating mutation. Interestingly, the exon 11-activating mutation was L576P, the same mutation that characterizes the rare c-kit mutation-positive cases of malignant melanoma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for c-kit suggested that most seminomas are probably polysomic for c-kit and there was not a significant difference in c-kit FISH characteristics between the mutation-positive and mutation-negative cases. The use of high-resolution melting amplicon analysis as a screening technique will allow for the rapid identification of patients with testicular seminomas whose tumors contain c-kit-activating mutations. This could benefit patients whose tumors are refractory to standard therapeutic protocols.","16741525","IVD","16741525","1"
"Drug insight: Mechanisms and sites of action of ursodeoxycholic acid in cholestasis.","2006","Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) exerts anticholestatic effects in various cholestatic disorders. Several potential mechanisms and sites of action of UDCA have been unraveled in clinical and experimental studies, which could explain its beneficial effects. The relative contribution of these mechanisms to the anticholestatic action of UDCA depends on the type and stage of the cholestatic injury. In early-stage primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, protection of injured cholangiocytes against the toxic effects of bile acids might prevail. Stimulation of impaired hepatocellular secretion by mainly post-transcriptional mechanisms, including stimulation of synthesis, targeting and apical membrane insertion of key transporters, seems to be relevant in more advanced cholestasis. In intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, stimulation of impaired hepatocellular secretion could be crucial for rapid relief of pruritus and improvement of serum liver tests, as it is in some forms of drug-induced cholestasis. In cystic fibrosis, stimulation of cholangiocellular calcium-dependent secretion of chloride and bicarbonate ions could have a major impact. Inhibition of bile-acid-induced hepatocyte apoptosis can have a role in all states of cholestasis that are characterized by hepatocellular bile-acid retention. Different mechanisms of action could, therefore, contribute to the beneficial effect of UDCA under various cholestatic conditions.","16741551","IVD","16741525","2"
"[Status and clinical implication of c-kit and PDGFRA mutations in 165 cases of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)].","2006","OBJECTIVE. To investigate the status of c-kit and PDGFRA mutations of GIST in a the large sample of Chinese patients. METHOD. One hundred and sixty-five cases were evaluated for the presence of c-kit and PDGFRA mutations. Exon 9, 11, 13, 17 of c-kit and exon 12, 18 of PDGFRA were analyzed by PCR amplification and direct sequencing. RESULTS. Immunohistochemical demonstrations of KIT (CD117) were seen in 94% of the cases (155/165). Overall, c-kit mutations were identified in 76.1% (118/155) of CD117 positive cases: 67.1% (104/155) involving exon 11, 7.1% (11/155) involving exon 9, 1.3% (2/155) involving exon 13 and 0.6% (1/155) involving exon 17. The c-kit exon 11 mutations were mostly heterogeneous and clustered in the classic ""hot spot"" at the 5' end of the exon, including in-frame deletion and point mutation. The second ""hot spots"" were internal tandem duplications (ITD) at the 3' end of the exon, which were associated with female patient, older age, stomach location and low mitotic counts. The exon 9 mutations correlated with a distinct subset of GISTs involving the small bowel of young male patients. A new point mutation of L641P was identified in exon 13. PDGFRA mutations were present in 50% (5/10) of CD117-negative GISTs, all involving exon 18 with the majority of mutations being D842V. One novel in-frame deletion of IMHD mutation at codon 843 - 846 with S847T was identified. GISTs with PDGFRA mutations were often larger tumors arising from the omentum/mesentery of young male patients with high risk of aggressive behavior. CONCLUSIONS. The vast majority of GISTs in this study harbored c-kit and PDGFRA mutations, there were non-random relations between the gene mutation patterns and the locations of GISTs. It appears that Chinese GIST patients have some unique mutation patterns. It is necessary to evaluate the gene mutations status of GISTs to guide target therapy.","16776995","IVD","16776995","1"
"[Study of androgen receptor and phosphoglycerate kinase gene polymorphism in major cellular components of the so-called pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma].","2006","OBJECTIVE. To study the clonality of polygonal cells and surface cuboidal cells in the so-called pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma (PSH). METHODS. 17 female surgically resected PSH were found. The polygonal cells and surface cuboidal cells of the 17 PSH cases were microdissected from routine hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. Genomic DNA was extracted, pretreated through incubation with methylation-sensitive restrictive endonuclease HhaI or HpaII, and amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction for X chromosome-linked androgen receptor (AR) and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) genes. The length polymorphism of AR gene was demonstrated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. The PGK gene products were treated with Bst XI and resolved on agarose gel. RESULTS. Amongst the 17 female cases of PSH, 15 samples were successfully amplified for AR and PGK genes. The rates of polymorphism were 53% (8/15) and 27% (4/15) for AR and PGK genes respectively. Polygonal cells and surface cuboidal cells of 10 cases which were suitable for clonality study, showed the same loss of alleles (clonality ratio = 0) or unbalanced methylation pattern (clonality ratio < 0.25).

The polygonal cells and surface cuboidal cells in PSH demonstrate patterns of monoclonal proliferation, indicating that both represent true neoplastic cells.","16776996","IVD","16776995","2"
"Prospective phase II study of gefitinib for chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations.","2006","PURPOSE. This study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy and the feasibility of gefitinib for chemotherapy-naïve patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. PATIENTS AND METHODS. The EGFR gene status in various tumor samples obtained from chemotherapy-naïve advanced NSCLC patients was examined by DNA sequencing of EGFR exons 18 to 23. Patients harboring EGFR mutations received gefitinib (250 mg/d) alone. The response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and toxicity profile were assessed prospectively. RESULTS. Between June 2004 and October 2005, 75 patients were examined for the EGFR status, and 25 patients (33%) harbored EGFR mutations. EGFR mutations were significantly frequent in females (P < .01) and never or light smokers (P < .001). Sixteen patients with EGFR mutations were enrolled onto the study. The overall response rate in these patients was 75% (95% CI, 54% to 96%), and the disease control rate was 88% (95% CI, 71% to 100%). The median PFS time of these patients was 9.7 months (95% CI, 7.4 to 9.9 months). No life-threatening toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION. Treatment with gefitinib alone for chemotherapy-naïve NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations could achieve a high efficacy with acceptable toxicity. To assess the proper timing of gefitinib in such patients, a subsequent randomized trial comparing gefitinib with standard chemotherapy is warranted.","16785471","IA","16785471","1"
"Genetic variations in radiation and chemotherapy drug action pathways predict clinical outcomes in esophageal cancer.","2006","PURPOSE. Understanding how specific genetic variants modify drug action pathways may provide informative blueprints for individualized chemotherapy. METHODS. We applied a pathway-based approach to examine the impact of a comprehensive panel of genetic polymorphisms on clinical outcomes in 210 esophageal cancer patients. RESULTS. In the Cox proportional hazards model, MTHFR Glu429Ala variant genotypes were associated with significantly improved survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.89) in patients treated with fluorouracil (FU). The 3-year survival rates for patients with the variant genotypes and the wild genotypes were 65.26% and 46.43%, respectively. Joint analysis of five polymorphisms in three FU pathway genes showed a significant trend for reduced recurrence risk and longer recurrence-free survival as the number of adverse alleles decreased (P = .004). For patients receiving platinum drugs, the MDR1 C3435T variant allele was associated with significantly reduced recurrence risk (HR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.64) and improved survival (HR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.85). In nucleotide excision repair genes, there was a significant trend for a decreasing risk of death with a decreasing number of high-risk alleles (P for trend = .0008). In base excision repair genes, the variant alleles of XRCC1 Arg399Gln were significantly associated with the absence of pathologic complete response (odds ratio = 2.75; 95% CI, 1.14 to 6.12) and poor survival (HR = 1.92; 95% CI, 1.00 to 3.72). CONCLUSION. Several biologically plausible associations between individual single nucleotide polymorphisms and clinical outcomes were found. Our data also strongly suggest that combined pathway-based analysis may provide valuable prognostic markers of clinical outcomes.","16785472","IA","16785471","2"
"HER2 kinase domain mutation results in constitutive phosphorylation and activation of HER2 and EGFR and resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","2006","HER2/Neu gene mutations have been identified in lung cancer. Expression of a HER2 mutant containing a G776(YVMA) insertion in exon 20 was more potent than wild-type HER2 in associating with and activating signal transducers, phosphorylating EGFR, and inducing survival, invasiveness, and tumorigenicity. HER2(YVMA) transphosphorylated kinase-dead EGFR(K721R) and EGFR(WT) in the presence of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Knockdown of mutant HER2 in H1781 lung cancer cells increased apoptosis and restored sensitivity to EGFR TKIs. The HER2 inhibitors lapatinib, trastuzumab, and CI-1033 inhibited growth of H1781 cells and cells expressing exogenous HER2(YVMA). These data suggest that (1) HER2(YVMA) activates cellular substrates more potently than HER2(WT); and (2) cancer cells expressing this mutation remain sensitive to HER2-targeted therapies but insensitive to EGFR TKIs.","16843263","IVD","16843263","1"
"Targeting ADAM-mediated ligand cleavage to inhibit HER3 and EGFR pathways in non-small cell lung cancer.","2006","We describe here the existence of a heregulin-HER3 autocrine loop, and the contribution of heregulin-dependent, HER2-mediated HER3 activation to gefitinib insensitivity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

"A phase 2 trial of the FLT3 inhibitor lestaurtinib (CEP701) as first-line treatment for older patients with acute myeloid leukemia not considered fit for intensive chemotherapy.","2006","Activating mutations of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) are present in approximately one third of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with adverse prognosis. The important role played by FLT3 in the survival and proliferation of blasts, and its overexpression in most patients with AML, make FLT3 an attractive therapeutic target. We undertook a phase 2 trial of the FLT3-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor lestaurtinib (CEP701) used as monotherapy in untreated older patients with AML not considered fit for intensive chemotherapy, irrespective of FLT3 mutation status. Lestaurtinib was administered orally for 8 weeks, initially at a dose of 60 mg twice daily, escalating to 80 mg twice daily, and was generally well tolerated. Clinical activity, manifest as transient reductions in bone marrow and peripheral-blood blasts or longer periods of transfusion independence, was seen in 3 (60%) of 5 patients with mutated FLT3 and 5 (23%) of 22 evaluable wild-type FLT3 patients. Laboratory data demonstrated that clinical responses occurred where the presence of sustained FLT3-inhibitory drug levels were combined with in vitro cytotoxic sensitivity of blasts to lestaurtinib. Further evaluation of this compound, in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy or other targeted agents, is warranted in both FLT3 mutant and wild-type patients.","16857985","IIIC","16857985","1"
"CD45RA on human CD8 T cells is sensitive to the time elapsed since the last antigenic stimulation.","2006","The expression of CD45RA on CCR7- human CD8+ memory T cells is widely considered to be a marker of terminal differentiation. We studied the time course of CD45RA and CCR7 expression on human antitumoral cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones and blood CD8+ T cells after antigenic stimulation. Our results indicate that CD45RA+ CCR7- CD8+ T cells are resting memory cells that, upon antigenic stimulation and during the next 10 days, proliferate, lose CD45RA, and transiently acquire CCR7. In the absence of further antigenic stimulation, they progressively re-express CD45RA and become CD45RA+ CCR7-. We conclude that the expression of CD45RA on these cells is indicative of the time elapsed since the last antigenic stimulation rather than the incapacity to proliferate or particularly high lytic potential. This concept leads to a reinterpretation of the significance of the presence of CD45RA+ CD8+ memory cells in patients affected by viral infections or by cancer.","16857986","IIIC","16857985","2"

"Allelic dilution obscures detection of a biologically significant resistance mutation in EGFR-amplified lung cancer.","2006","EGFR is frequently mutated and amplified in lung adenocarcinomas sensitive to EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. A secondary mutation, T790M, has been associated with acquired resistance but has not been shown to be sufficient to render EGFR mutant/amplified lung cancers resistant to EGFR inhibitors. We created a model for studying acquired resistance to gefitinib by prolonged exposure of a gefitinib-sensitive lung carcinoma cell line (H3255; EGFR mutated and amplified) to gefitinib in vitro. The resulting resistant cell line acquired a T790M mutation in a small fraction of the amplified alleles that was undetected by direct sequencing and identified only by a highly sensitive HPLC-based technique. In gefitinib-sensitive lung cancer cells with EGFR mutations and amplifications, exogenous introduction of EGFR T790M effectively conferred resistance to gefitinib and continued ErbB-3/PI3K/Akt signaling when in cis to an activating mutation. Moreover, continued activation of PI3K signaling by the PIK3CA oncogenic mutant, p110alpha E545K, was sufficient to abrogate gefitinib-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that allelic dilution of biologically significant resistance mutations may go undetected by direct sequencing in cancers with amplified oncogenes and that restoration of PI3K activation via either a T790M mutation or other mechanisms can provide resistance to gefitinib.","16906227","VD","16906227","1"

"Somatic activation of KIT in distinct subtypes of melanoma.","2006","PURPOSE. Melanomas on mucosal membranes, acral skin (soles, palms, and nail bed), and skin with chronic sun-induced damage have infrequent mutations in BRAF and NRAS, genes within the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway commonly mutated in melanomas on intermittently sun-exposed skin. This raises the question of whether other aberrations are occurring in the MAP kinase cascade in the melanoma types with infrequent mutations of BRAF and NRAS. PATIENTS AND METHODS. We analyzed array comparative genomic hybridization data from 102 primary melanomas (38 from mucosa, 28 from acral skin, and 18 from skin with and 18 from skin without chronic sun-induced damage) for DNA copy number aberrations specific to melanoma subtypes where mutations in BRAF and NRAS are infrequent. A narrow amplification on 4q12 was found, and candidate genes within it were analyzed. RESULTS. Oncogenic mutations in KIT were found in three of seven tumors with amplifications. Examination of all 102 primary melanomas found mutations and/or copy number increases of KIT in 39% of mucosal, 36% of acral, and 28% of melanomas on chronically sun-damaged skin, but not in any (0%) melanomas on skin without chronic sun damage. Seventy-nine percent of tumors with mutations and 53% of tumors with multiple copies of KIT demonstrated increased KIT protein levels. CONCLUSION. KIT is an important oncogene in melanoma. Because the majority of the KIT mutations we found in melanoma also occur in imatinib-responsive cancers of other types, imatinib may offer an immediate therapeutic benefit for a significant proportion of the global melanoma burden.","16908931","IVD","16908931","1"
"T-cell immunity to the folate receptor alpha is prevalent in women with breast or ovarian cancer.","2006","PURPOSE. Studies have demonstrated that the generation of immunity to tumor antigens is associated with improved prognosis for many cancers. A candidate antigen is the folate receptor alpha (FRalpha), which is overexpressed in breast and ovarian cancers. Our goal in this study was to attain a better understanding of the extent of endogenous FRalpha immunity. METHODS. Using a CD4+ T cell epitope prediction algorithm, we predicted promiscuous epitopes of FRalpha, and tested for immunity in 30 breast (n = 17) or ovarian (n = 13) cancer patients and 18 healthy donors using enzyme-linked immunospot analysis. RESULTS. Fourteen peptides were predicted, seven each from the carboxy- and amino-terminus halves of the protein. More than 70% of patients demonstrated immunity to at least one FRalpha peptide. Patients responded to an average of 3 +/- 0.5 peptides, whereas healthy donors responded to 1 +/- 0.4 peptides (P = .004). Five peptides were recognized by more than 25% of patients. Responses to three peptides were higher (P < .05) in patients than in healthy donors, suggesting augmented immunity. Compared with healthy individuals, patients developed higher immunity to the amino-terminus half of the receptor (P = .03). There was no difference between each group in the responses to nonspecific (P = .2) and viral stimuli (P = .5). Lastly, patients demonstrated elevated levels of FRalpha antibodies consistent with a coordinated immune response. CONCLUSION. These findings demonstrate that the FRalpha is a target of the immune system in breast and ovarian cancer patients. Understanding which antigens are targeted by the immune system may be important for prognosis or immune-based therapies.","16908932","IVD","16908931","2"
"Adverse prognostic significance of KIT mutations in adult acute myeloid leukemia with inv(16) and t(8;21): a Cancer and Leukemia Group B Study.","2006","PURPOSE. To analyze the prognostic impact of mutated KIT (mutKIT) in core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with inv(16)(p13q22) and t(8;21)(q22;q22). PATIENTS AND METHODS. Sixty-one adults with inv(16) and 49 adults with t(8;21), assigned to postremission therapy with repetitive cycles of higher dose cytarabine were analyzed for mutKIT in exon 17 (mutKIT17) and 8 (mutKIT8) by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing at diagnosis. The median follow-up was 5.3 years. RESULTS. Among patients with inv(16), 29.5% had mutKIT (16% with mutKIT17 and 13% with sole mutKIT8). Among patients with t(8;21), 22% had mutKIT (18% with mutKIT17 and 4% with sole mutKIT8). Complete remission rates of patients with mutKIT and wild-type KIT (wtKIT) were similar in both cytogenetic groups. In inv(16), the cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was higher for patients with mutKIT (P = .05; 5-year CIR, 56% v 29%) and those with mutKIT17 (P = .002; 5-year CIR, 80% v 29%) compared with wtKIT patients. Once data were adjusted for sex, mutKIT predicted worse overall survival (OS). In t(8;21), mutKIT predicted higher CIR (P = .017; 5-year CIR, 70% v 36%), but did not influence OS. CONCLUSION. We report for the first time that mutKIT, and particularly mutKIT17, confer higher relapse risk, and both mutKIT17 and mutKIT8 appear to adversely affect OS in AML with inv(16). We also confirm the adverse impact of mutKIT on relapse risk in t(8;21) AML. We suggest that patients with core-binding factor AML should be screened for mutKIT at diagnosis for both prognostic and therapeutic purposes, given that activated KIT potentially can be targeted with novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","16921041","IVD","16921041","1"
"Lack of benefit of maintenance paclitaxel in first-line chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer.","2006","PURPOSE. This randomized study compared maintenance paclitaxel with control in metastatic breast cancer patients not experiencing progression after first-line anthracycline/paclitaxel combination chemotherapy. METHODS. Between April 1998 and October 2003, 459 metastatic breast cancer patients received first-line combination chemotherapy with epirubicin or doxorubicin plus paclitaxel. Of these, 255 who had a response or stable disease were then randomly assigned onto the Maintenance Paclitaxel 1 (MANTA1) study, comparing eight courses of maintenance paclitaxel versus control (ie, no additional chemotherapy administration). The primary end point was progression-free survival. RESULTS. The study was prematurely concluded after a futility analysis, which was performed on 215 of the 238 patients randomly assigned within December 2002. Of these, 109 patients were assigned to maintenance paclitaxel and 106 were assigned to stopping chemotherapy. No significant difference in median progression-free survival was observed (8.0 months for maintenance paclitaxel and 9.0 months for control). There was no significant difference in median survival time (28.0 v 29.0 months). When the Bayesian method for monitoring clinical trials was applied to these data, even under an enthusiastic prior distribution, in the posterior distribution there was only an 8.6% chance of observing a 3-month improvement in median progression-free survival in the group receiving maintenance paclitaxel. After these results study accrual was closed. CONCLUSION. Compared with control, the administration of additional courses of paclitaxel in patients who achieve disease control after six to eight courses of first-line anthracycline plus paclitaxel combination chemotherapy does not improve progression-free survival.","16921042","IVD","16921041","2"
"Array CGH analysis in primary gastrointestinal stromal tumors: cytogenetic profile correlates with anatomic site and tumor aggressiveness, irrespective of mutational status.","2007","Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) comprise a biologically diverse group of neoplasms with respect to activating mutations in either KIT or PDGFRA, histology, anatomical site of origin, and clinical aggressiveness. In this study, we applied the high resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) technology to 66 primary GISTs (40 gastric and 26 nongastric, 48 with KIT and 18 with PDGFRA mutations) for identification of novel high-level alterations and for characterization of genotype-related genomic changes. All cases had genomic imbalances with the highest occurrence of 14q (73%), 1p (62%), 22q (59%), 15q (38%), and 13q (29%) losses. Our data indicate that loss of chromosome 14 and/or 22 is an early change in GIST tumorigenesis irrespective of tumor genotype. Furthermore, DNA copy number changes showed a site dependent pattern. These included lower incidence of losses at 14q (87% vs. 35%), and higher frequency of losses at 1p (45% vs. 85%) and 15q (17% vs. 69%) in nongastric versus gastric site (P<0.001 for all). However, in the multivariate analysis with adjustment to tumor risk stratification, only the 14q loss site-dependent pattern of distribution retained its significance. These findings suggest that loss of 14q is a relatively less frequent genetic event in the development of nongastric GISTs, the lack of which is most likely substituted by the accumulation of 1p/15q and other changes. The novel minimal overlapping regions of deletion at 1p (1p36.32-1p35.2, 1p34.1, and 1p22.1-1p21.3), 13q (13q14.11-q14.2 and 13q32.3-q33.1), and 15q23 were delineated, which point to chromosomal regions that may harbor genes relevant to the development of these neoplasms.","17171690","IVD","17171690","1"
"The M53I mutation in CDKN2A is a founder mutation that predominates in melanoma patients with Scottish ancestry.","2007","Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A have been shown to predispose to cutaneous malignant melanoma. The M53I mutation is the most common CDKN2A mutation identified in Scottish melanoma patients and is also found in a small number of families in other countries. The aim of this study was to determine whether the occurrence of this mutation is due to a common ancestor originating from Scotland, and if so, to estimate how long ago the mutation arose. We examined 18 families carrying the M53I mutation: six from Scotland, five from Canada, four from Australia, and three from America. Haplotypes derived from segregation of seven informative microsatellite markers flanking CDKN2A were constructed in each family. Our findings show that 14 of 18 families carry a common ancestral haplotype on which the mutation arose approximately 88 generations ago (1-LOD-unit support interval 44-198 generations). This haplotype is very rare in controls, which supports the idea that it is a common founder mutation haplotype. The four M53I families that do not share the consensus haplotype may in fact have arisen from the same founder, but this is potentially obscured by presumed replication slippage for some of the microsatellite markers tested.","17171691","IVD","17171690","2"
"Epidermal growth factor receptor activation in glioblastoma through novel missense mutations in the extracellular domain.","2006","BACKGROUND. Protein tyrosine kinases are important regulators of cellular homeostasis with tightly controlled catalytic activity. Mutations in kinase-encoding genes can relieve the autoinhibitory constraints on kinase activity, can promote malignant transformation, and appear to be a major determinant of response to kinase inhibitor therapy. Missense mutations in the EGFR kinase domain, for example, have recently been identified in patients who showed clinical responses to EGFR kinase inhibitor therapy. METHODS AND FINDINGS. Encouraged by the promising clinical activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors in treating glioblastoma in humans, we have sequenced the complete EGFR coding sequence in glioma tumor samples and cell lines. We identified novel missense mutations in the extracellular domain of EGFR in 13.6% (18/132) of glioblastomas and 12.5% (1/8) of glioblastoma cell lines. These EGFR mutations were associated with increased EGFR gene dosage and conferred anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity to NIH-3T3 cells. Cells transformed by expression of these EGFR mutants were sensitive to small-molecule EGFR kinase inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS. Our results suggest extracellular missense mutations as a novel mechanism for oncogenic EGFR activation and may help identify patients who can benefit from EGFR kinase inhibitors for treatment of glioblastoma.","17177598","VD","17177598","1"
"Elevated serum levels of interferon-regulated chemokines are biomarkers for active human systemic lupus erythematosus.","2006","BACKGROUND. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a serious systemic autoimmune disorder that affects multiple organ systems and is characterized by unpredictable flares of disease. Recent evidence indicates a role for type I interferon (IFN) in SLE pathogenesis; however, the downstream effects of IFN pathway activation are not well understood. Here we test the hypothesis that type I IFN-regulated proteins are present in the serum of SLE patients and correlate with disease activity. METHODS AND FINDINGS. We performed a comprehensive survey of the serologic proteome in human SLE and identified dysregulated levels of 30 cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and soluble receptors. Particularly striking was the highly coordinated up-regulation of 12 inflammatory and/or homeostatic chemokines, molecules that direct the movement of leukocytes in the body. Most of the identified chemokines were inducible by type I IFN, and their levels correlated strongly with clinical and laboratory measures of disease activity. CONCLUSIONS. These data suggest that severely disrupted chemokine gradients may contribute to the systemic autoimmunity observed in human SLE. Furthermore, the levels of serum chemokines may serve as convenient biomarkers for disease activity in lupus.","17177599","VD","17177598","2"
"Response to treatment and survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer undergoing somatic EGFR mutation testing.","2007","Somatic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are associated with clinical response and prolonged survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We began screening patients for somatic EGFR mutations by DNA sequencing as part of clinical care in 2004. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 278 patients with NSCLC referred for EGFR testing over a 10-month period. Tumor samples underwent direct DNA sequence analyses of EGFR exons 18 through 24. We determined the clinical characteristics and EGFR mutation status of the patients and analyzed their response to therapy and survival. EGFR somatic mutations were identified in 68 (24%) of patients. A minimal smoking history was the strongest clinical predictor of harboring a mutation. In multivariable analyses, each pack-year of smoking corresponded to a 5% decreased likelihood of having an EGFR mutation. Among 92 patients with unresectable disease undergoing subsequent systemic therapy, EGFR mutations were associated with an increased response rate to EGFR TKIs (p < .0001) but not chemotherapy. Overall survival was significantly prolonged in EGFR mutation-positive patients (p = .001), with a median survival of 3.1 years compared with 1.6 years in mutation-negative patients, after adjusting for age, gender, and stage at diagnosis. Integrating molecular profiling into clinical care is feasible in NSCLC patients and provides useful clinical information.","17285735","IVD","17285735","1"

In order to assess which pre-existent or emerging kinase domain mutations are associated with decreased clinical efficacy of desatinib, we analyzed BCR-ABL kinase sequences before and during treatment in 21 Ph+ patients who failed to respond to or relapsed during dasatinib therapy.

"L576P KIT mutation in anal melanomas correlates with KIT protein expression and is sensitive to specific kinase inhibition.","2007","Activating mutations in either BRAF or NRAS are seen in a significant number of malignant melanomas, but their incidence appears to be dependent to ultraviolet light exposure. Thus, BRAF mutations have the highest incidence in non-chronic sun damaged (CSD), and are uncommon in acral, mucosal and CSD melanomas. More recently, activating KIT mutations have been described in rare cases of metastatic melanoma, without further reference to their clinical phenotypes. This finding is intriguing since KIT expression is downregulated in most melanomas progressing to more aggressive lesions. In this study, we investigated a group of anal melanomas for the presence of BRAF, NRAS, KIT and PDGFRA mutations. A heterozygous KIT exon 11 L576P substitution was identified in 3 of 20 cases tested. The 3 KIT mutation-carrying tumors were strongly immunopositive for KIT protein. No KIT mutations were identified in tumors with less than 4+ KIT immunostaining. NRAS mutation was identified in one tumor. No BRAF or PDGFRA mutations were identified in either KIT positive or negative anal melanomas. In vitro drug testing of stable transformant Ba/F3 KIT(L576P) mutant cells showed sensitivity for dasatinib (previously known as BMS-354825), a dual SRC/ABL kinase inhibitor, and imatinib. However, compared to an imatinib-sensitive KIT mutant, dasatinib was potent at lower doses than imatinib in the KIT(L576P) mutant. These results suggest that a subset of anal melanomas show activating KIT mutations, which are susceptible for therapy with specific kinase inhibitors.","17372901","IVD","17372901","1"
"Cytoplasmic accumulation of connexin32 protein enhances motility and metastatic ability of human hepatoma cells in vitro and in vivo.","2007","Connexins have long been believed to suppress tumour development during carcinogenesis by exerting gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC). Although GJIC is abrogated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), connexin32 (Cx32) protein tends to remain expressed in cytoplasm, but not in cell-cell contact areas; thus, it is incapable of forming gap junctions. Hypothesising that cytoplasmic Cx32 protein that has accumulated in HCC should have its proper functions, which are independent of GJIC, we established an inducible expression system of Cx32 in human HuH7 HCC cells, which were unable to support the formation of Cx32-mediated gap junctions, so that Cx32 protein could be overexpressed by doxycycline (Dox) withdrawal. Although the established clone HuH7 Tet-off Cx32 cells exhibited a 4-fold increase in Cx32 expression after Dox withdrawal, none of them were dye-coupled, and Cx32 protein was retained in the Golgi apparatus. However, the proliferation rate of the HuH7 Tet-off Cx32 cells was significantly higher in the Dox-free medium than in the Dox-supplemented one. Transwell assays also revealed that Dox withdrawal enhanced serum-stimulated motility and invasiveness into Matrigel of the HuH7 Tet-off Cx32 cells. Furthermore, when HuH7 Tet-off Cx32 cells were xenografted into the liver of SCID mice, only the mice to which no Dox was administered developed metastatic lesions, indicating that overexpression of cytoplasmic Cx32 protein induced metastasis of HuH7 cells.

Limited availability of tumoral tissue in non-small-cell lung cancer and presence of epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-independent responses call for investigation of other molecular predictive marker of gefitinib responsiveness. Therefore, CA repeat polymorphism in intron 1 was analyzed for its association with gefitinib responsiveness together with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation in Korean patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS. For 86 advanced non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with gefitinib, epidermal growth factor receptor mutation was analyzed by direct sequencing (exons 18-21) from tumor tissue and CA repeat polymorphism was assessed by fragment length analysis from tumor and/or normal tissue. RESULTS. CA repeat status was identical in 33 patients with matched tumor and normal tissue. CA repeat was low (sum of both alleles < or =37) in 40 (46.5%) and high (sum > or =38) in 46 (53.5%) patients. Although epidermal growth factor receptor mutation was more frequent in high CA repeat patients [17.5% (7/40) in low vs. 28.3% (13/46) in high, P=0.18], response rate was higher in low CA repeat patients [25.0% (10/40) in low vs. 13.0% (6/46) in high, P=0.16]. In multivariate analysis, low CA repeat was associated with better objective response (odds ratio 7.1, 95% confidence interval 1.2-40.8; P=0.029) and time-to-progression (hazard ratio 0.54, 95% confidence interval 0.34-0.88; P=0.014), independent of the epidermal growth factor receptor mutational status. CA repeat status was not associated with epidermal growth factor receptor expression. CONCLUSION. Low number of CA repeats in intron 1 of epidermal growth factor receptor is associated with gefitinib responsiveness in non-small-cell lung cancer patients independent of epidermal growth factor receptor mutation.","17429313","IVD","17429313","1"
"Influence of the UGT2B7 promoter region and exon 2 polymorphisms and comedications on Acyl-MPAG production in vitro and in adult renal transplant patients.","2007","INTRODUCTION. The polymorphic enzyme UGT2B7 metabolizes mycophenolic acid into acyl-mycophenolic acid-glucuronide (AcMPAG), a presumably toxic metabolite. This study aimed at investigating in vitro and in vivo the impact on AcMPAG production of: (i) the UGT2B7 gene G-842A single nucleotide polymorphism, in complete linkage disequilibrium with most other known single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region of this gene and with the C802T single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 2 (UGT2B*2); and (ii) of the other immunosuppressants given to renal transplant patients in association with mycophenolate mofetil. METHODS. We compared the production of AcMPAG by human liver microsomes genotyped for the UGT2B7 G-842A and C802T single nucleotide polymorphisms, and plasma AcMPAG concentrations in genotyped renal transplant patients administered mycophenolate mofetil associated with sirolimus (n=40), tacrolimus (n=24) or cyclosporin (n=28) and decreasing doses of corticosteroids, over the first 3 months after transplant. The effect of corticosteroids was also investigated in vitro using rats' liver microsomes. RESULTS. The two polymorphisms studied were in complete reverse linkage disequilibrium. AcMPAG production was 1.25 and 1.56-fold higher in G-842A and -842AA human liver microsomes, respectively, compared with GG-842 human liver microsomes (P=0.01). Enzyme kinetics showed 1.4 and 3.7-fold higher Vmax in the respective pools of human liver microsomes. Km values were 0.20, 0.25 and 0.44 mmol/l for the GG-842, G-842A and -842AA genotypes, respectively. This clear increase in Vmax is in favor of the implication of the promoter region polymorphisms, whereas the slighter increase in Km might be due to the UGT2B7*2 single nucleotide polymorphism. Consistently, the UGT2B7 genotype significantly influenced AcMPAG area under the curve (AUC0-9 h)/dose in patients on sirolimus at months 1 and 3 after transplant (P=0.04 for both). No effect was observed in patients on tacrolimus and possibly also on cyclosporin, maybe owing to pharmacokinetic interaction with mycophenolate. AcMPAG production was increased in corticosteroid-induced rat liver microsomes, consistent with the observed in-vivo decrease of mycophenolic acid metabolites AUC0-9 h/dose with time after transplant. CONCLUSION. Both UGT2B7 polymorphisms and co-medications significantly influenced AcMPAG production, but cyclosporin and tacrolimus hindered the phenotypic impact of this trait.","17429314","IVD","17429313","2"
"Sorafenib inhibits the imatinib-resistant KITT670I gatekeeper mutation in gastrointestinal stromal tumor.","2007","PURPOSE. Resistance is commonly acquired in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor who are treated with imatinib mesylate, often due to the development of secondary mutations in the KIT kinase domain. We sought to investigate the efficacy of second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as sorafenib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, against the commonly observed imatinib-resistant KIT mutations (KIT(V654A), KIT(T670I), KIT(D820Y), and KIT(N822K)) expressed in the Ba/F3 cellular system. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. In vitro drug screening of stable Ba/F3 KIT mutants recapitulating the genotype of imatinib-resistant patients harboring primary and secondary KIT mutations was investigated. Comparison was made to imatinib-sensitive Ba/F3 KIT mutant cells as well as Ba/F3 cells expressing only secondary KIT mutations. The efficacy of drug treatment was evaluated by proliferation and apoptosis assays, in addition to biochemical inhibition of KIT activation. RESULTS. Sorafenib was potent against all imatinib-resistant Ba/F3 KIT double mutants tested, including the gatekeeper secondary mutation KIT(WK557-8del/T670I), which was resistant to other kinase inhibitors. Although all three drugs tested decreased cell proliferation and inhibited KIT activation against exon 13 (KIT(V560del/V654A)) and exon 17 (KIT(V559D/D820Y)) double mutants, nilotinib did so at lower concentrations. CONCLUSIONS. Our results emphasize the need for tailored salvage therapy in imatinib-refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumors according to individual molecular mechanisms of resistance. The Ba/F3 KIT(WK557-8del/T670I) cells were sensitive only to sorafenib inhibition, whereas nilotinib was more potent on imatinib-resistant KIT(V560del/V654A) and KIT(V559D/D820Y) mutant cells than dasatinib and sorafenib.","17699867","VD","17699867","1"
"Hydroxamic acid analogue histone deacetylase inhibitors attenuate estrogen receptor-alpha levels and transcriptional activity: a result of hyperacetylation and inhibition of chaperone function of heat shock protein 90.","2007","PURPOSE. The molecular chaperone heat shock protein (hsp)-90 maintains estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha in an active conformation, allowing it to bind 17beta-estradiol (E2) and transactivate genes, including progesterone receptor (PR)-beta and the class IIB histone deacetylase HDAC6. By inhibiting HDAC6, the hydroxamic acid analogue pan-HDAC inhibitors (HA-HDI; e.g., LAQ824, LBH589, and vorinostat) induce hyperacetylation of the HDAC6 substrates alpha-tubulin and hsp90. Hyperacetylation of hsp90 inhibits its chaperone function, thereby depleting hsp90 client proteins. Here, we determined the effect of HA-HDIs on the levels and activity of ERalpha, as well as on the survival of ERalpha-expressing, estrogen-responsive human breast cancer MCF-7 and BT-474 cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. Following exposure to HA-HDIs, hsp90 binding, polyubiquitylation levels, and transcriptional activity of ERalpha, as well as apoptosis and loss of survival, were determined in MCF-7 and BT-474 cells. RESULTS. Treatment with HA-HDI induced hsp90 hyperacetylation, decreased its binding to ERalpha, and increased polyubiquitylation and depletion of ERalpha levels. HA-HDI treatment abrogated E2-induced estrogen response element-luciferase expression and attenuated PRbeta and HDAC6 levels. Exposure to HA-HDI also depleted p-Akt, Akt, c-Raf, and phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 levels, inhibited growth, and sensitized ERalpha-positive breast cancer cells to tamoxifen. CONCLUSIONS. These findings show that treatment with HA-HDI abrogates ERalpha levels and activity and could sensitize ERalpha-positive breast cancers to E2 depletion or ERalpha antagonists.","17699868","VD","17699867","2"
"Clonal evolution of resistance to imatinib in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","2007","PURPOSE. Resistance to imatinib mesylate is emerging as a clinical challenge in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Novel patterns of progression have been noted in a number of these patients. The objective of this study was to correlate molecular and radiologic patterns of imitinib-refractory disease with existing conventional criteria for disease progression. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. Patients with metastatic GIST treated with imatinib were followed with serial computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging and [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography. Where feasible, biopsies were done to document disease progression. RESULTS. A total of 89 patients were followed for a median of 43 months. Forty-eight patients developed progressive disease. A unique ""resistant clonal nodule"" pattern (defined as a new enhancing nodular focus enclosed within a preexisting tumor mass) was seen in 23 of 48 patients and was thought to represent emergence of clones resistant to imatinib. Nodules were demonstrable a median of 5 months (range, 0-13 months) before objective progression defined by tumor size criteria and were the first sign of progression in 18 of 23 patients. Median survival among patients whose first progression was nodular was 35.1 months, compared with 44.6 months for patients whose first progression met Southwest Oncology Group criteria (P = 0.31). Comparative tumor biopsies were done in 10 patients at baseline and from progressing nodules. Genotypic analyses of KIT and PDGFRA kinases were done, revealing new activating kinase mutations in 80% (8 of 10) of these patients. CONCLUSION. The resistant clonal nodule is a unique pattern of disease progression seen in patients with GISTs after an initial response to imatinib and reflects the emergence of imatinib-resistant clones. Conventional tumor measurements (Southwest Oncology Group/Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) do not detect this subtle finding. A new enhancing nodule growing within a preexisting tumor mass should be classified as a new lesion and be regarded, at least, as partial progression of GIST.","17875769","IVD","17875769","1"
"Prolonged efficacy of a single dose of the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid.","2007","PURPOSE. Bisphosphonates play a central role in the management of bone loss due to a range of disorders, including metastatic bone disease, cancer treatment-induced bone loss, and postmenopausal osteoporosis. With potent bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid, it may be possible to maintain efficacy with relatively infrequent administration. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. Sixty-six patients who were osteopenic at >1 year following curative cancer therapy received a single i.v. 4 mg dose of the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using double-beam X-ray absorptiometry scan and the bone resorption marker N-telopeptide of type II collagen was determined using a chemiluminescence ELISA assay. RESULTS. The single dose of zoledronic acid induced mean increases in bone BMD at the lumbar spine of 3.1%, 5.2%, and 5.3% and at the total hip of 2.7%, 3.5%, and 4.3% after 12, 24, and 36 months of follow-up, respectively (P < 0.001 at all time points). By 36 months, 84% of patients had achieved increase in BMD at the spine and 90% at the hip. The mean percentage decrease in the bone resorption marker N-telopeptide was approximately 58% at 6 weeks and 42%, 33%, and 31% at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. A single dose of zoledronic acid in patients with low BMD results in a sustained increase in BMD and a corresponding decrease in bone resorption. Very infrequent administration of zoledronic acid may have clinical benefits in terms of convenience, reduced toxicity, improved compliance, and cost.","17875770","IVD","17875769","2"
"Different prognostic roles of mutations in the helical and kinase domains of the PIK3CA gene in breast carcinomas.","2007","PURPOSE. In breast cancer, the PIK3CA gene is frequently mutated at ""hotspots"" in exons 9 and 20, corresponding to the helical and kinase domains, respectively. We decided to investigate the association of PIK3CA mutations with pathologic features and clinical outcome in a large series of patients with breast cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. Frozen samples from 163 consecutive patients were analyzed for PIK3CA mutations using PCR single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequence analyses. RESULTS. We identified 46 missense mutations, 24 (53%) in exon 9, and 21 (47%) in exon 20. Twelve (50%) of the 24 mutations in exon 9 were of the E542K type and 11 (46%) were of the E545K type. Twenty (95%) of the 21 mutations in exon 20 were H1047R substitutions. Mutations in exon 9 were more frequent in lobular carcinomas (42% of cases) than in ductal carcinoma (11% of cases; P = 0.002). At univariate survival analysis, PIK3CA exon 20 mutations were associated with prolonged overall and disease-free survival, whereas mutations in exon 9 were associated with significantly worse prognosis. At multivariate analysis, exon 9 PIK3CA mutations were the strongest independent factor to predict poor prognosis for disease-free survival (P = 0.0003) and overall survival (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION. Our data show that exon 9 PIK3CA mutations are typical of infiltrating lobular carcinomas. In addition, they indicate that PIK3CA mutations in different exons are of different prognostic value: exon 9 mutations are independently associated with early recurrence and death, whereas exon 20 PIK3CA mutations are associated with optimal prognosis.","17947469","IVD","17947469","1"
"Evaluation of an 111In-radiolabeled peptide as a targeting and imaging agent for ErbB-2 receptor expressing breast carcinomas.","2007","PURPOSE. The cellular targeting and tumor imaging properties of a novel ErbB-2-avid peptide, discovered from bacteriophage display, were evaluated in human breast carcinoma cells and in breast carcinoma-xenografted mice. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. The affinity of the ErbB-2 targeting peptide KCCYSL and its alanine substituted counterparts for the extracellular domain (ECD) of purified recombinant ErbB-2 (ErbB-2-ECD) was assessed by fluorescence titration. Binding of the KCCYSL peptide to breast and prostate carcinoma cells was analyzed by confocal microscopy. A DOTA(GSG)-KCCYSL peptide conjugate was radiolabeled with 111In, and stability, target binding, and internalization were analyzed in vitro. In vivo biodistribution and single-photon emission computed tomography imaging studies were done with the radiolabeled peptide in MDA-MB-435 human breast tumor-bearing severe combined immunodeficient mice. RESULTS. KCCYSL peptide exhibited high affinity (295 +/- 56 nmol/L) to ErbB-2-ECD. Substitution of alanine for lysine, tryptophan, and cysteine reduced the peptide affinity approximately 1- to 2.4-fold, whereas replacing leucine completely abolished binding. Both biotin-KCCYSL and 111In-DOTA(GSG)-KCCYSL were capable of binding ErbB-2-expressing human breast carcinoma cells in vitro. Approximately 11% of the total bound radioactivity was internalized in the carcinoma cells. Competitive binding studies indicated that the radiolabeled peptide exhibited an IC(50) value of 42.5 +/- 2.76 nmol/L for the breast carcinoma cells. 111In-DOTA(GSG)-KCCYSL was stable in serum and exhibited rapid tumor uptake (2.12 +/- 0.32 %ID/g) at 15 min postinjection and extended retention coupled with rapid whole body disappearance, as observed by biodistribution and single-photon emission computed tomography imaging studies, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. The DOTA(GSG)-KCCYSL peptide has the potential to be used as a tumor-imaging agent and a vehicle for specific delivery of radionuclide or cytotoxic agents for tumors overexpressing ErbB-2.","17947470","IVD","17947469","2"
"Prognostic significance of somatic RET oncogene mutations in sporadic medullary thyroid cancer: a 10-year follow-up study.","2008","BACKGROUND. Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a well-differentiated thyroid tumor that maintains the typical features of C cells. An advanced stage and the presence of lymph node metastases at diagnosis have been demonstrated to be the most important bad prognostic factors. Somatic RET mutations have been found in 40-50% of MTCs. Although a relationship between somatic mutations and bad prognosis has been described, data are controversial and have been performed in small series with short-term follow ups. The aim of this study was to verify the prognostic value of somatic RET mutations in a large series of MTCs with a long follow up. METHODS. We studied 100 sporadic MTC patients with a 10.2 yr mean follow-up. RET gene exons 10-11 and 13-16 were analyzed. The correlation between the presence/absence of a somatic RET mutation, clinical/pathological features, and outcome of MTC patients was evaluated. RESULTS. A somatic RET mutation was found in 43 of 100 (43%) sporadic MTCs. The most frequent mutation (34 of 43, 79%) was M918T. RET mutation occurrence was more frequent in larger tumors (P=0.03), and in MTC with node and distant metastases (P<0.0001 and P=0.02, respectively), thus, a significant correlation was found with a more advanced stage at diagnosis (P=0.004). A worse outcome was also significantly correlated with the presence of a somatic RET mutation (P=0.002). Among all prognostic factors found to be correlated with a worse outcome, at multivariate analysis only the advanced stage at diagnosis and the presence of a RET mutation showed an independent correlation (P<0.0001 and P=0.01, respectively). Finally, the survival curves of MTC patients showed a significantly lower percentage of surviving patients in the group with RET mutations (P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS. We demonstrated that the presence of a somatic RET mutation correlates with a worse outcome of MTC patients, not only for the highest probability to have persistence of the disease, but also for a lower survival rate in a long-term follow up. More interestingly, the presence of a somatic RET mutation correlates with the presence of lymph node metastases at diagnosis, which is a known bad prognostic factor for the definitive cure of MTC patients.","18073307","IIC","18073307","1"
"Granulosa cell survival and proliferation are altered in polycystic ovary syndrome.","2008","CONTEXT. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) represents the most common endocrine abnormality in women of reproductive age. The cause of PCOS remains largely unknown, but studies suggest an intrinsic ovarian abnormality. OBJECTIVE. The objective of the study was to test our hypothesis that differences in granulosa cell proliferation and apoptosis may underlie abnormalities that affect follicular development. PATIENTS. Fourteen women with anovulatory PCOS and nine women with regular ovulatory cycles participated in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES. Immunocytochemistry on granulosa cells to investigate apoptotic and proliferation rates, together with real-time RT-PCR to analyze gene expression profiles of apoptotic regulators, was measured. SETTING. The study was conducted at a university hospital. DESIGN. Granulosa cells were prepared from follicular fluid aspirated from 4- to 8-mm follicles of unstimulated ovaries during routine laparoscopy or laparotomy from women with anovulatory PCOS and those with regular ovulatory cycles. RESULTS. Significantly lower apoptotic rates were found in granulosa cells from patients with PCOS, compared with women with regular ovulatory cycles (P=0.004). Lower apoptotic rates were associated with decreased levels of the apoptotic effector caspase-3 (P=0.001) and increased levels of the anti-apoptotic survival factor cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins-2 in the PCOS group that were coupled to higher proliferation rates (P=0.032). Gene expression profiling confirmed the immunocytochemical findings. CONCLUSIONS. Our findings indicate that there are significant differences in the rate of cell death and proliferation in granulosa cell populations in PCOS patients. These are associated with decreased expression of apoptotic effectors and increased expression of a cell survival factor. These results provide new insights that may be useful in developing specific therapeutic intervention strategies in PCOS.","18073308","IIC","18073307","2"
"PIK3CA exon 20 mutation is independently associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer patients.","2008","BACKGROUND. Prognostic factors that could select breast cancer patients with poor survival, and influence clinical trials of targeted therapy, are needed. However, the reported observations regarding the impact of PI3KCA mutation on breast cancers are controversial. METHODS. We analyzed exons 4, 7, 9, and 20 of PI3KCA on a series of 158 patients. Clinicopathological characteristics were correlated with the mutation data. RESULTS. Among 152 patients who were available for follow-up (median follow-up time, 6.57 years), 26% had PIK3CA mutations, more than half of which occurred in exon 20. The five-year survival rate of patients with exon 20 mutations (46%) was significantly lower than that of patients without (75%) (p = 0.0054). Multivariate analysis showed that PIK3CA exon 20 mutations and nodal involvement were independent risk factors for overall survival. The relative risk of death in patients with PIK3CA exon 20 mutations was 2.881 (95% CI, 1.406-5.900; p = 0.0038). CONCLUSIONS. PIK3CA mutations are common in invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast. Our result suggests that PIK3CA exon 20 mutation is an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in breast cancer patients, indicating that differences in patient numbers with PIK3CA exon 20 mutations in study and control arms should be avoided in clinical trials of PI3K inhibitors.","18183466","IVD","18183466","1"
"The relationship between alcohol consumption and glycemic control among patients with diabetes: the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry.","2008","BACKGROUND. Alcohol consumption is a common behavior. Little is known about the relationship between alcohol consumption and glycemic control among people with diabetes. OBJECTIVE. To evaluate the association between alcohol consumption and glycemic control. DESIGN. Survey follow-up study, 1994-1997, among Kaiser Permanente Northern California members. PATIENTS. 38,564 adult diabetes patients. MEASUREMENTS. Self-reported alcohol consumption, and hemoglobin A1C (A1C), assessed within 1 year of survey date. Linear regression of A1C by alcohol consumption was performed, adjusted for sociodemographic variables, clinical variables, and diabetes disease severity. Least squares means estimates were derived. RESULTS. In multivariate-adjusted models, A1C values were 8.88 (lifetime abstainers), 8.79 (former drinkers), 8.90 (<0.1 drink/day), 8.71 (0.1-0.9 drink/day), 8.51 (1-1.9 drinks/day), 8.39 (2-2.9 drinks/day), and 8.47 (>/=3 drinks/day). Alcohol consumption was linearly (p < 0.001) and inversely (p = 0.001) associated with A1C among diabetes patients. CONCLUSIONS. Alcohol consumption is inversely associated with glycemic control among diabetes patients. This supports current clinical guidelines for moderate levels of alcohol consumption among diabetes patients. As glycemic control affects incidence of complications of diabetes, the lower A1C levels associated with moderate alcohol consumption may translate into lower risk for complications.","18183468","IVD","18183466","2"
"Comparison of imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib and INNO-406 in imatinib-resistant cell lines.","2008","We compared the growth-inhibitory effects and inhibition profile of the SRC family kinases (SFKs) of imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib and INNO-406. Dasatinib exhibited the strongest potency against BCR-ABL with little selectivity over SFKs. Nilotinib exhibited a weaker affinity than the other inhibitors, but was highly specific for ABL and may be useful for the treatment of P-glycoprotein overexpressing leukemic cells. INNO-406 had an intermediate affinity for BCR-ABL between that of dasatinib and nilotinib, and inhibited only SFKs LCK and LYN among SFKs.

"Toxicity and characterization of cholinesterase-inhibition induced by diisopropyl fluorophosphate in Artemia salina larvae.","2009","The acute toxicity of diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) on three age classes of Artemia salina was evaluated. An increase in toxicity of this organophosphorous (OP) compound was found following longer development of A. salina larvae. The effects of pretreatment with the non-selective muscarinic antagonist atropine, the two reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitors physostigmine and pyridostigmine, and the cholinesterase-reactivating oxime 2-pyridine aldoxime methoiodide (2-PAM), as individual and combined pretreatments, on DFP-induced lethality in 24h Artemia were also investigated. The lethal action of DFP was not prevented by pretreatment of 24h Artemia with atropine, physostigmine, and pyridostigmine, while 2-PAM proved effective against intoxication with this OP compound. The inhibitory effects of combinations of atropine (10(-5)M) plus 2-PAM or physostigmine were greater than those elicited by either drug alone, with the maximum protection afforded being 100%. Pretreatment with 2-PAM (10(-6)M) plus physostigmine or pyridostigmine was ineffective. These results suggest that the combinations of atropine plus 2-PAM or physostigmine are effective in the prevention of the lethal effects induced by DFP in A. salina larvae.","18191451","VD","18191450","2"
"Mutations in the RAS-MAPK, PI(3)K (phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase) signaling network correlate with poor survival in a population-based series of colon cancers.","2008","The RAS-MAPK, PI (3)K signaling pathways form a network that play a central role in tumorigenesis. The BRAF, KRAS and PI3KCA genes code 3 partners of this network and have been found to be activated by mutation in colorectal cancer; these mutations lead to unrestricted cell growth. We evaluated the clinicopathological features and the prognosis of patients with activated-network colon cancers in a population-based study. A total of 586 colon adenocarcinomas were evaluated using sequencing for mutations of KRAS and PI3KCA, and allelic discrimination for mutation of BRAF. Clinicopathological characteristics were correlated to the risk of bearing a mutation of the network using logistic regression. Three-year survival rates were compared with the Log rank test. A multivariate survival analysis using the Cox model was performed. After adjustment for age and microsatellite instability, activation of the network by mutation of at least 1 of the 3 genes was significantly associated with female sex (p = 0.02) and proximal location (p < 0.001). Lower levels of 3-year survival were associated with activation of the network by mutation of at least 1 of the 3 genes (59.4 and 69.4%, respectively; p = 0.009). These results remained significant in a multivariate analysis adjusted for sex, age, location, stage and microsatellite instability (HR = 1.48; CI CI(95%) = [1.07-2.04]). Our study is the first report to underline the potential role of RAS-MAPK, PI (3)K network mutations on survival in colon cancers. Because of the role of this signaling network on anticancer agents, the evaluation of its mutations could have clinical implications.","18224685","IVD","18224685","1"
"Designing antibodies for the inhibition of gastrin activity in tumoral cell lines.","2008","Gastrin and its derivatives are becoming important targets for immunotherapy of pancreatic, gastric and colorectal tumors. This study was conducted to design antibodies able to block gastrin binding to the gastrin/cholecystokinin-2 (CCK-2) receptor in order to delay tumor growth. The authors have used different gastrin molecules, combined with the diphtheria toxoid, to generate and select human single chain variable fragments (scFvs) as well as mouse monoclonal antibodies and scFvs against different regions of gastrin. There was a remarkable conservation in the antibody repertoire against gastrin, independently of the approach and the species. The germlines most frequently used in gastrin antibody formation were identified. Three different epitopes were identified in the gastrin molecule. The resulting mouse monoclonal antibodies and scFvs were analyzed for gastrin neutralization using Colo 320 WT cells, which overexpress the CCK-2 receptor. The gastrin neutralizing activity assay showed that N-terminal specific mouse monoclonal antibodies were more efficient to inhibit proliferation of Colo 320 WT cells than the anti-C terminal antibodies. Moreover, the human antigastrin scFvs obtained in this study inhibited significantly the proliferation of Colo 320 tumoral cells. These findings should contribute to a more rational design of antibody-based antigastrin therapies in cancer, including passive administration of human antibodies with blocking activity.","18224686","IVD","18224685","2"
"Mutant FLT3: a direct target of sorafenib in acute myelogenous leukemia.","2008","BACKGROUND. Internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in the juxtamembrane domain-coding sequence of the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene have been identified in 30% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and are associated with a poor prognosis. The kinase inhibitor sorafenib induces growth arrest and apoptosis at much lower concentrations in AML cell lines that harbor FLT3-ITD mutations than in AML cell lines with wild-type FLT3. METHODS. The antileukemic activity of sorafenib was investigated in isogenic murine Ba/F3 AML cell lines that expressed mutant (ITD, D835G, and D835Y) or wild-type human FLT3, in primary human AML cells, and in a mouse leukemia xenograft model. Effects of sorafenib on apoptosis and signaling in AML cell lines were investigated by flow cytometry and immunoblot analysis, respectively, and the in vivo effects were determined by monitoring the survival of leukemia xenograft-bearing mice treated with sorafenib (groups of 15 mice). In a phase 1 clinical trial, 16 patients with refractory or relapsed AML were treated with sorafenib on different dose schedules. We determined their FLT3 mutation status by a polymerase chain reaction assay and analyzed clinical responses by standard criteria. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS. Sorafenib was 1000- to 3000-fold more effective in inducing growth arrest and apoptosis in Ba/F3 cells with FLT3-ITD or D835G mutations than in Ba/F3 cells with FLT3-D835Y mutant or wild-type FLT3 and inhibited the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in ITD mutant but not wild-type FLT3 protein. In a mouse model, sorafenib decreased the leukemia burden and prolonged survival (median survival in the sorafenib-treated group vs the vehicle-treated group = 36.5 vs 16 days, difference = 20.5 days, 95% confidence interval = 20.3 to 21.3 days; P = .0018). Sorafenib reduced the percentage of leukemia blasts in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow of AML patients with FLT3-ITD (median percentages before and after sorafenib: 81% vs 7.5% [P = .016] and 75.5% vs 34% [P = .05], respectively) but not in patients without this mutation. CONCLUSION. Sorafenib may have therapeutic efficacy in AML patients whose cells harbor FLT3-ITD mutations.","18230792","VD","18230792","1"
"Endogenous sex hormones and prostate cancer: a collaborative analysis of 18 prospective studies.","2008","BACKGROUND. Sex hormones in serum have been hypothesized to influence the risk of prostate cancer. We performed a collaborative analysis of the existing worldwide epidemiologic data to examine these associations in a uniform manner and to provide more precise estimates of risks. METHODS. Data on serum concentrations of sex hormones from 18 prospective studies that included 3886 men with incident prostate cancer and 6438 control subjects were pooled by the Endogenous Hormones and Prostate Cancer Collaborative Group. Relative risks (RRs) of prostate cancer by fifths of serum hormone concentration were estimated by use of conditional logistic regression with stratification by study, age at recruitment, and year of recruitment. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS. No associations were found between the risk of prostate cancer and serum concentrations of testosterone, calculated free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, androstanediol glucuronide, estradiol, or calculated free estradiol. The serum concentration of sex hormone-binding globulin was modestly inversely associated with prostate cancer risk (RR in the highest vs lowest fifth = 0.86, 95% confidence interval = 0.75 to 0.98; P(trend) = .01). There was no statistical evidence of heterogeneity among studies, and adjustment for potential confounders made little difference to the risk estimates. CONCLUSIONS. In this collaborative analysis of the worldwide data on endogenous hormones and prostate cancer risk, serum concentrations of sex hormones were not associated with the risk of prostate cancer.","18230794","VD","18230792","2"
"Somatic mutations in the RET proto-oncogene in sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas.","2008","The frequency and prognostic relevance of RET proto-oncogene somatic mutations in sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) remain controversial. In order to study somatic mutations in the RET proto-oncogene in sporadic MTCs found in the Czech population and to correlate these mutations with clinical and pathological characteristics, we investigated 48 truly sporadic MTCs by sequencing classical risk exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16. From the 48 tumors studied, 23 (48%) had somatic mutation in the RET proto-oncogene in exons 10, 11, 15 or 16. The classical somatic mutation Met918Thr in exon 16 was only found in 13 tumors (27%). In five cases, multiple somatic mutations and deletions were detected. A statistically significant correlation between the presence of somatic mutation with more advanced pathological TNM stages was observed. Other clinical and pathological characteristics did not show any statistical significant association with the presence or absence of somatic mutation.","18282654","IVD","18282654","1"
"Measurement of peak CSF flow velocity at cerebral aqueduct, before and after lumbar CSF drainage, by use of phase-contrast MRI: utility in the management of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.","2008","OBJECTIVE. Since it was first described, normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) and its treatment by means of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting have been the focus of much investigation. Whatever be the cause of NPH, it has been hypothesized that in this disease there occurs decreased arterial expansion and an increased brain expansion leading to increased transmantle pressure. We cannot measure the latter, but fortunately the effect of these changes (increased peak flow velocity through the aqueduct) can be quantified with cine phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This investigation was thus undertaken to characterize and measure CSF peak flow velocity at the level of the aqueduct, before and after lumbar CSF drainage, by means of a phase-contrast cine MRI and determine its role in selecting cases for shunt surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS. 37 patients with clinically suspected NPH were included in the study. Changes in the hyperdynamic peak CSF flow velocity with 50 ml lumbar CSF drainage (mimicking shunt) were evaluated in them for considering shunt surgery. RESULTS. 14 out of 15 patients who were recommended for shunt surgery, based on changes peak flow velocity after lumbar CSF drainage, improved after shunt surgery. None of the cases which were not recommended for shunt surgery, based on changes in CSF peak flow velocity after lumbar CSF drainage, improved after shunt surgery (2 out of 22 cases). CONCLUSION. The study concluded that the phase-contrast MR imaging, done before and after CSF drainage, is a sensitive method to support the clinical diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus, selecting patients of NPH who are likely to benefit from shunt surgery, and to select patients of NPH who are not likely to benefit from shunt surgery.","18282655","IVD","18282654","2"
"Wild-type KRAS is required for panitumumab efficacy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.","2008","PURPOSE. Panitumumab, a fully human antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), has activity in a subset of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Although activating mutations in KRAS, a small G-protein downstream of EGFR, correlate with poor response to anti-EGFR antibodies in mCRC, their role as a selection marker has not been established in randomized trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS. KRAS mutations were detected using polymerase chain reaction on DNA from tumor sections collected in a phase III mCRC trial comparing panitumumab monotherapy to best supportive care (BSC). We tested whether the effect of panitumumab on progression-free survival (PFS) differed by KRAS status. RESULTS. KRAS status was ascertained in 427 (92%) of 463 patients (208 panitumumab, 219 BSC). KRAS mutations were found in 43% of patients. The treatment effect on PFS in the wild-type (WT) KRAS group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.45; 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.59) was significantly greater (P < .0001) than in the mutant group (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.36). Median PFS in the WT KRAS group was 12.3 weeks for panitumumab and 7.3 weeks for BSC. Response rates to panitumumab were 17% and 0%, for the WT and mutant groups, respectively. WT KRAS patients had longer overall survival (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.82; treatment arms combined). Consistent with longer exposure, more grade III treatment-related toxicities occurred in the WT KRAS group. No significant differences in toxicity were observed between the WT KRAS group and the overall population. CONCLUSION. Panitumumab monotherapy efficacy in mCRC is confined to patients with WT KRAS tumors. KRAS status should be considered in selecting patients with mCRC as candidates for panitumumab monotherapy.","18316791","IB","18316791","1"
"Randomized phase II adjuvant trial of dose-dense docetaxel before or after doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide in axillary node-positive breast cancer.","2008","PURPOSE. An anthracycline-based combination followed by, or combined with, a taxane is the sequence used in most adjuvant chemotherapy regimens. We hypothesized that administering the taxane before the anthracycline combination would be associated with fewer dose reductions and delays than the reverse sequence. To test this hypothesis, a randomized phase II multicenter adjuvant chemotherapy trial was performed. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Fifty-six patients with axillary node-positive, nonmetastatic breast cancer were randomly assigned either to group A (docetaxel [DOC] 75 mg/m(2) intravenously [IV] every 14 days for four cycles followed by doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) [AC] IV every 14 days for four cycles); or to group B (AC followed by DOC) at the identical doses and schedule. Pegfilgrastim 6 mg subcutaneous injection was administered 1 day after the chemotherapy in all treatment cycles. The primary objective was to administer DOC without dose reductions or delays before or after AC and calculate the relative dose intensity (RDI) of DOC and AC. RESULTS. The majority of toxicities were grade 0 to 2 irrespective of sequence. The RDI for DOC was 0.96 and 0.82, respectively, in groups A (DOC followed by AC) and B (AC followed by DOC), with more frequent dose reductions occurring in group B (46% v 18%). The RDI for AC was 0.95 and 0.98 in groups A and B, respectively. CONCLUSION. The administration of DOC before AC results in fewer DOC dose reductions and a higher RDI than the reverse sequence. Larger trials evaluating the sequence of DOC before anthracyclines are justified.","18316792","IB","18316791","2"
"Phase I pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of the oral, small-molecule mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 inhibitor AZD6244 (ARRY-142886) in patients with advanced cancers.","2008","PURPOSE. To assess the tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PKs), and pharmacodynamics (PDs) of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitor AZD6244 (ARRY-142886) in patients with advanced cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS. In part A, patients received escalating doses to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD). In both parts, blood samples were collected to assess PK and PD parameters. In part B, patients were stratified by cancer type (melanoma v other) and randomly assigned to receive the MTD or 50% MTD. Biopsies were collected to determine inhibition of ERK phosphorylation, Ki-67 expression, and BRAF, KRAS, and NRAS mutations. RESULTS. Fifty-seven patients were enrolled. MTD in part A was 200 mg bid, but this dose was discontinued in part B because of toxicity. The 50% MTD (100 mg bid) was well tolerated. Rash was the most frequent and dose-limiting toxicity. Most other adverse events were grade 1 or 2. The PKs were less than dose proportional, with a median half-life of approximately 8 hours and inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells at all dose levels. Paired tumor biopsies demonstrated reduced ERK phosphorylation (geometric mean, 79%). Five of 20 patients demonstrated >or= 50% inhibition of Ki-67 expression, and RAF or RAS mutations were detected in 10 of 26 assessable tumor samples. Nine patients had stable disease (SD) for >or= 5 months, including two patients with SD for 19 (thyroid cancer) and 22 (uveal melanoma plus renal cancer) 28-day cycles. CONCLUSION. AZD6244 was well tolerated with target inhibition demonstrated at the recommended phase II dose. PK analyses supported twice-daily dosing. Prolonged SD was seen in a variety of advanced cancers. Phase II studies are ongoing.","18390968","IIB","18390968","1"
"Graft-versus-lymphoma effect for aggressive T-cell lymphomas in adults: a study by the Société Francaise de Greffe de Moëlle et de Thérapie Cellulaire.","2008","PURPOSE. Aggressive T-cell lymphomas (ATCLs) represent 10% to 15% of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) in adults. ATCLs show a worse prognosis than B-cell lymphomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS. On behalf of the Société Française de Greffe de Moëlle et de Thérapie Cellulaire, we conducted a retrospective analysis including 77 ATCL patients who underwent allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (alloSCT). RESULTS. The different diagnosis included anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL; n = 27), peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS; n = 27), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL; n = 11), hepatosplenic gamma/delta lymphoma (HSL; n = 3), T-cell granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-GLL; n = 1), nasal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (nasal-NK/L; n = 3) or non-nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma (non-nasal-NK/L; n = 2), enteropathy-type T-cell (n = 1), and human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1 lymphoma (n = 2). Fifty-seven patients received a myeloablative conditioning regimen. Donors were human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched in 70 cases and related in 60 cases. Thirty-one patients were in complete remission (CR) at the time of alloSCT, whereas 26 were in partial response (PR). Five-year toxicity-related mortality (TRM) incidence was 33% (95% CI, 24% to 46%). The 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates were 57% (95% CI, 45% to 68%) and 53% (95% CI, 41% to 64%), respectively. In multivariate analysis, chemoresistant disease (stable, refractory, or progressing disease) at the time of alloSCT and the occurrence of severe grade 3 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) were the strongest adverse prognostic factors for OS (P = .03 and .03, respectively). Disease status at transplantation significantly influenced the 5-year EFS (P = .003), and an HLA-mismatched donor increased TRM (P = .04). CONCLUSION. We conclude that alloSCT is a potentially efficient therapy for NK/T lymphomas and is worth further investigation through prospective clinical trials.","18390969","IIB","18390968","2"
"BIBW2992, an irreversible EGFR/HER2 inhibitor highly effective in preclinical lung cancer models.","2008","Genetic alterations in the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients are associated with sensitivity to treatment with small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Although first-generation reversible, ATP-competitive inhibitors showed encouraging clinical responses in lung adenocarcinoma tumors harboring such EGFR mutations, almost all patients developed resistance to these inhibitors over time. Such resistance to first-generation EGFR inhibitors was frequently linked to an acquired T790M point mutation in the kinase domain of EGFR, or upregulation of signaling pathways downstream of HER3. Overcoming these mechanisms of resistance, as well as primary resistance to reversible EGFR inhibitors driven by a subset of EGFR mutations, will be necessary for development of an effective targeted therapy regimen. Here, we show that BIBW2992, an anilino-quinazoline designed to irreversibly bind EGFR and HER2, potently suppresses the kinase activity of wild-type and activated EGFR and HER2 mutants, including erlotinib-resistant isoforms. Consistent with this activity, BIBW2992 suppresses transformation in isogenic cell-based assays, inhibits survival of cancer cell lines and induces tumor regression in xenograft and transgenic lung cancer models, with superior activity over erlotinib. These findings encourage further testing of BIBW2992 in lung cancer patients harboring EGFR or HER2 oncogenes.","18408761","VD","18408761","1"
"Methyl jasmonate binds to and detaches mitochondria-bound hexokinase.","2008","Cellular bio-energetic metabolism and mitochondria are recognized as potential targets for anticancer agents, due to the numerous relevant peculiarities cancer cells exhibit. Jasmonates are anticancer agents that interact directly with mitochondria. The aim of this study was to identify mitochondrial molecular targets of jasmonates. We report that jasmonates bind to hexokinase and detach it from the mitochondria and its mitochondrial anchor-the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), as judged by hexokinase immunochemical and activity determinations, surface plasmon resonance analysis and planar lipid bilayer VDAC-activity analysis. Furthermore, the susceptibility of cancer cells and mitochondria to jasmonates is dependent on the expression of hexokinase, evaluated using hexokinase-overexpressing transfectants and its mitochondrial association. Many types of cancer cells exhibit overexpression of the key glycolytic enzyme, hexokinase, and its excessive binding to mitochondria. These characteristics are considered to play a pivotal role in cancer cell growth rate and survival. Thus, our findings provide an explanation for the selective effects of jasmonates on cancer cells. Most importantly, this is the first demonstration of a cytotoxic mechanism based on direct interaction between an anticancer agent and hexokinase. The proposed mechanism can serve to guide development of a new selective approach for cancer therapy.","18408762","VD","18408761","2"
"Role of KRAS and EGFR as biomarkers of response to erlotinib in National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group Study BR.21.","2008","PURPOSE. To evaluate the effect of KRAS and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) genotype on the response to erlotinib treatment in the BR.21, placebo-controlled trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS. We analyzed 206 tumors for KRAS mutation, 204 tumors for EGFR mutation, and 159 tumors for EGFR gene copy by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). We reanalyzed EGFR deletion/mutation using two highly sensitive techniques that detect abnormalities in samples with 5% to 10% tumor cellularity. KRAS mutation was analyzed by direct sequencing. RESULTS. Thirty patients (15%) had KRAS mutations, 34 (17%) had EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutations, and 61 (38%) had high EGFR gene copy (FISH positive). Response rates were 10% for wild-type and 5% for mutant KRAS (P = .69), 7% for wild-type and 27% for mutant EGFR (P = .03), and 5% for EGFR FISH-negative and 21% for FISH-positive patients (P = .02). Significant survival benefit from erlotinib therapy was observed for patients with wild-type KRAS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.69, P = .03) and EGFR FISH positivity (HR = 0.43, P = .004) but not for patients with mutant KRAS (HR = 1.67, P = .31), wild-type EGFR (HR = 0.74, P = .09), mutant EGFR (HR = 0.55, P = .12), and EGFR FISH negativity (HR = 0.80, P = .35). In multivariate analysis, only EGFR FISH-positive status was prognostic for poorer survival (P = .025) and predictive of differential survival benefit from erlotinib (P = .005). CONCLUSION. EGFR mutations and high copy number are predictive of response to erlotinib. EGFR FISH is the strongest prognostic marker and a significant predictive marker of differential survival benefit from erlotinib.","18626007","IIB","18626007","1"
"Climate-related increase in the prevalence of urolithiasis in the United States.","2008","An unanticipated result of global warming is the likely northward expansion of the present-day southeastern U.S. kidney stone ""belt."" The fraction of the U.S. population living in high-risk zones for nephrolithiasis will grow from 40% in 2000 to 56% by 2050, and to 70% by 2095. Predictions based on a climate model of intermediate severity warming (SRESa1b) indicate a climate-related increase of 1.6-2.2 million lifetime cases of nephrolithiasis by 2050, representing up to a 30% increase in some climate divisions. Nationwide, the cost increase associated with this rise in nephrolithiasis would be $0.9-1.3 billion annually (year-2000 dollars), representing a 25% increase over current expenditures. The impact of these changes will be geographically concentrated, depending on the precise relationship between temperature and stone risk. Stone risk may abruptly increase at a threshold temperature (nonlinear model) or increase steadily with temperature change (linear model) or some combination thereof. The linear model predicts increases by 2050 that are concentrated in California, Texas, Florida, and the Eastern Seaboard; the nonlinear model predicts concentration in a geographic band stretching from Kansas to Kentucky and Northern California, immediately south of the threshold isotherm.","18626008","IIB","18626007","2"
"Germline and somatic c-met mutations in multifocal/bilateral and sporadic papillary renal carcinomas of selected patients.","2008","Papillary renal carcinoma (PRC) comprises about 10% of all kidney epithelial tumors. Familiar/hereditary papillary renal carcinomas (HPRCs) have been described, but the majority of cases seem to be sporadic. HPRC is characterized by the predisposition to develop bilateral, multifocal renal tumors. Activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TK) of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, c-met, have been identified in both hereditary and sporadic PRC. The main aim of this study was to examine a family with no history of PRC in which the proband was a female patient affected by multiple and bilateral PRC at early onset. DNA mutation analysis has been performed by direct sequencing of exons 14-21 of c-met gene which include the TK domain. The proband displayed the germline c-met missense mutation g.3522G--> A in exon 16. Two other family members were found to carry the same mutation. The mutation analysis extended to 15 selected patients, allowed to identify the first case of an Italian patient affected by PRC displaying the somatic missense mutation g.3997 T-->C curved arrow C located in exon 19 of c-met. The mutation frequency of the selected-based population of PRC patients in this report was 12.5%. Furthermore, the phosphorylated c-met expression detected by immunohistochemistry in PRCs with germline/somatic or no c-met mutation, supports the concept that c-met activation may occur in PRC oncogenesis by c-met mutations and/or c-met over-expression.","18636147","IVD","18636147","1"
"Evaluation of the potential anti-cancer activity of the antidepressant sertraline in human colon cancer cell lines and in colorectal cancer-xenografted mice.","2008","Evidence has been provided of the anti-proliferative activity of certain antidepressants, mainly the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). We tested the effect of different antidepressants on cell viability and proliferation of human colorectal carcinoma cell lines HT29 and the multi-drug resistant (MDR) LS1034. The SSRIs, paroxetine and sertraline, induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell viability and proliferation in the two cell lines (IC50 8-15 micro M). When compared to cytotoxic agents e.g. doxorubicin, vincristine and 5-fluorouracil, the SSRIs showed comparable activity (HT29) or a superior effect (LS1034). Using flow cytometry analysis, we found that the two SSRIs arrested cells at the G0/G1 stage and stimulated DNA fragmentation in a dose-dependent manner. The SSRIs (10 and 20 microM) increased caspase-3 activation. Western blot analysis showed an increase after 24 h in c-Jun and a decrease in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. The results suggest a proapoptotic activity for the active SSRIs accompanied by mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade activation and Bcl-2 inhibition. In vivo, we used CD1 nude mice xenografted subcutaneously with HT29 cells. On day 8, after cell inoculation sertraline or paroxetine (15 mg/kg x3/week i.p.) were administered to animals (6/group), which were monitored weekly (for 5 weeks) for tumor volume and body weight. At 5 weeks, the animals survived, with no significant difference in body weight. Sertraline, though not paroxetine, significantly inhibited tumor growth. Collectively, our results suggest that the widely-used antidepressant, sertraline, possesses a potential anti-tumor activity, which circumvents the MDR mechanism. Since SSRI therapy is frequently indicated in cancer patients, the use of sertraline in colon cancer patients with co-morbidity of depression seems attractive.","18636148","IVD","18636147","2"

Lymphocytes were isolated from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients before, during, and after presurgical chemoradiotherapy. Similar samples were taken from prostate cancer patients receiving standard RT. The level of CD8(+) T cells capable of binding tetramers for the tumor-associated antigen survivin, which is overexpressed in both cancer types, was enumerated in HLA-A*0201 patient samples. CD4(+), CD25(high), Foxp3(+) cells were also enumerated to evaluate therapy-induced changes in T(regulatory) cells.

RESULTS. Survivin-specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes were detected in the peripheral blood of CRC and prostate cancer patients and increased after therapy in some, but not all, patients. Increases were more common in CRC patients whose tumor was downstaged after chemoradiotherapy. Biopsy specimens from this cohort generally had higher nuclear to cytoplasmic survivin expression. T(regulatory) cells generally increased in the circulation following therapy but only in CRC patients. CONCLUSION.

"An integrative genomic and proteomic analysis of PIK3CA, PTEN, and AKT mutations in breast cancer.","2008","Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway aberrations are common in cancer. By applying mass spectroscopy-based sequencing and reverse-phase protein arrays to 547 human breast cancers and 41 cell lines, we determined the subtype specificity and signaling effects of PIK3CA, AKT, and PTEN mutations and the effects of PIK3CA mutations on responsiveness to PI3K inhibition in vitro and on outcome after adjuvant tamoxifen. PIK3CA mutations were more common in hormone receptor-positive (34.5%) and HER2-positive (22.7%) than in basal-like tumors (8.3%). AKT1 (1.4%) and PTEN (2.3%) mutations were restricted to hormone receptor-positive cancers. Unlike AKT1 mutations that were absent from cell lines, PIK3CA (39%) and PTEN (20%) mutations were more common in cell lines than tumors, suggesting a selection for these but not AKT1 mutations during adaptation to culture. PIK3CA mutations did not have a significant effect on outcome after adjuvant tamoxifen therapy in 157 hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients. PIK3CA mutations, in comparison with PTEN loss and AKT1 mutations, were associated with significantly less and inconsistent activation of AKT and of downstream PI3K/AKT signaling in tumors and cell lines. PTEN loss and PIK3CA mutation were frequently concordant, suggesting different contributions to pathophysiology. PTEN loss rendered cells significantly more sensitive to growth inhibition by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 than did PIK3CA mutations. Thus, PI3K pathway aberrations likely play a distinct role in the pathogenesis of different breast cancer subtypes. The specific aberration present may have implications for the selection of PI3K-targeted therapies in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.","18676830","IVD","18676830","1"

Here, we describe a distinct approach that consists of using tissue surgically resected from lung metastatic lesions and comparing their gene expression profiles with those from nonpulmonary sites, all coming from breast cancer patients. We show that the gene expression profiles of organ-specific metastatic lesions can be used to predict lung metastasis in breast cancer. We identified a set of 21 lung metastasis-associated genes. Using a cohort of 72 lymph node-negative breast cancer patients, we developed a 6-gene prognostic classifier that discriminated breast primary cancers with a significantly higher risk of lung metastasis. We then validated the predictive ability of the 6-gene signature in 3 independent cohorts of breast cancers consisting of a total of 721 patients. Finally, we show that the signature improves risk stratification independently of known standard clinical variables and a previously established lung metastasis signature based on an experimental breast cancer metastasis model.","18676831","IVD","18676830","2"
"An integrative genomic and proteomic analysis of PIK3CA, PTEN, and AKT mutations in breast cancer.","2008","Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway aberrations are common in cancer. By applying mass spectroscopy-based sequencing and reverse-phase protein arrays to 547 human breast cancers and 41 cell lines, we determined the subtype specificity and signaling effects of PIK3CA, AKT, and PTEN mutations and the effects of PIK3CA mutations on responsiveness to PI3K inhibition in vitro and on outcome after adjuvant tamoxifen. PIK3CA mutations were more common in hormone receptor-positive (34.5%) and HER2-positive (22.7%) than in basal-like tumors (8.3%). AKT1 (1.4%) and PTEN (2.3%) mutations were restricted to hormone receptor-positive cancers. Unlike AKT1 mutations that were absent from cell lines, PIK3CA (39%) and PTEN (20%) mutations were more common in cell lines than tumors, suggesting a selection for these but not AKT1 mutations during adaptation to culture. PIK3CA mutations did not have a significant effect on outcome after adjuvant tamoxifen therapy in 157 hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients. PIK3CA mutations, in comparison with PTEN loss and AKT1 mutations, were associated with significantly less and inconsistent activation of AKT and of downstream PI3K/AKT signaling in tumors and cell lines. PTEN loss and PIK3CA mutation were frequently concordant, suggesting different contributions to pathophysiology. PTEN loss rendered cells significantly more sensitive to growth inhibition by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 than did PIK3CA mutations. Thus, PI3K pathway aberrations likely play a distinct role in the pathogenesis of different breast cancer subtypes. The specific aberration present may have implications for the selection of PI3K-targeted therapies in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.","18676830","VD","18676830","1"

"BRAF(V600E) mutation and outcome of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma: a 15-year median follow-up study.","2008","BACKGROUND. The BRAF(V600E) mutation is the most frequent genetic alteration in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The role of BRAF(V600E) mutation as a poor prognostic factor has been controversially reported in series with short-term follow-ups. In this study we verified the prognostic value of the BRAF(V600E) mutation in PTC patients with a long-term follow-up. METHODS. We studied 102 PTC patients with a median follow-up of 15 yr. The BRAF(V600E) mutation was analyzed by PCR-single-strand conformational polymorphism and sequencing. The correlation between the presence/absence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation, clinicopathological features, and outcome of PTC patients were evaluated. RESULTS. The BRAF(V600E) mutation was found in 38 of 102 (37.3%) PTC patients, and was significantly more frequent in patients older than 60 yr (P = 0.02), in advanced stages (P = 0.03), and in cases with vascular invasion (P = 0.02). At univariate analysis the worst outcome for PTC patients was significantly correlated with clinicopathological features (i.e. age, tumor size, extrathyroid extension, lymph node and distant metastases, advanced stage, vascular endothelial growth factor expression, and vascular invasion) and the BRAF(V600E) mutation (P < 0.002). However, at multivariate analysis only the BRAF(V600E) mutation showed an independent correlation with the worst outcome (P = 0.03). Moreover, the survival curves of PTC patients showed a lower percentage of survivors in the BRAF(V600E)-mutated group (P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS. In this study the BRAF(V600E) mutation correlated with the worst outcome for PTC patients, who were not only at a higher risk not to be cured but also for death. In particular, the BRAF(V600E) mutation was demonstrated to be a poor prognostic factor independent from other clinicopathological features.","18682506","IVD","18682506","1"
"Type I membrane klotho expression is decreased and inversely correlated to serum calcium in primary hyperparathyroidism.","2008","CONTEXT. The type I membrane protein Klotho was recently shown to mediate PTH secretion in parathyroid cells in response to low extracellular calcium. In contrast, Klotho inhibits PTH secretion indirectly through the action of fibroblast growth factor-23. Abnormal Klotho expression in parathyroid disorders remains to be elucidated. OBJECTIVE. The aim of the study was to determine: 1) Klotho expression in parathyroid adenomas from patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) compared to normal tissue; and 2) its relation to the serum calcium and PTH levels. DESIGN. Surgically removed parathyroid glands (n = 40) and four normal parathyroid tissue specimens were analyzed for Klotho mRNA and protein levels by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. In vitro effects of calcium on Klotho mRNA expression were studied in bovine parathyroid cells. RESULTS. Klotho mRNA levels were significantly decreased (n = 23) or undetectable (n = 17) in parathyroid adenomas compared to normal tissues (P < 0.001). Reduced Klotho protein expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Klotho mRNA levels were inversely correlated to serum calcium (r = -0.97; P < 0.0001), and calcium dose-dependently decreased Klotho mRNA expression in normal parathyroid cells in vitro (P < 0.01). Serum calcium was the only significant marker of Klotho expression in multivariate analysis with calcium, phosphate, PTH, and adenoma weight as independent variables. CONCLUSIONS. Parathyroid Klotho expression is decreased or undetectable in pHPT. We provide evidence that 1) serum calcium is strongly associated with parathyroid Klotho expression in pHPT; and 2) abnormal PTH secretion in hypercalcemic pHPT subjects is mediated by Klotho-independent mechanisms.","18682507","IVD","18682506","2"
"CRAF inhibition induces apoptosis in melanoma cells with non-V600E BRAF mutations.","2009","Here, we identify a panel of melanoma lines with non-V600E mutations in BRAF. These G469E- and D594G-mutated melanomas were found to exhibit constitutive levels of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) and low levels of phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (pMEK) and were resistant to MEK inhibition. Upon treatment with the CRAF inhibitor sorafenib, these lines underwent apoptosis and associated with mitochondrial depolarization and relocalization of apoptosis-inducing factor, whereas the BRAF-V600E-mutated melanomas did not. Studies have shown low-activity mutants of BRAF (G469E/D594G) instead signal through CRAF. Unlike BRAF, CRAF directly regulates apoptosis through mitochondrial localization where it binds to Bcl-2 and phosphorylates BAD. The CRAF inhibitor sorafenib was found to induce a time-dependent reduction in both BAD phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression in the D594G/G469E lines only. Knockdown of CRAF using a lentiviral shRNA suppressed both Bcl-2 expression and induced apoptosis in the D594G melanoma line but not in a V600E-mutated line. Finally, we showed in a series of xenograft studies that sorafenib was more potent at reducing the growth of tumors with the D594G mutation than those with the V600E mutation. In summary, we have identified a group of melanomas with low-activity BRAF mutations that are reliant upon CRAF-mediated survival activity.","18794803","VD","18794803","1"
"Loss of Hus1 sensitizes cells to etoposide-induced apoptosis by regulating BH3-only proteins.","2008","The Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 (9-1-1) cell cycle checkpoint complex plays a key role in the DNA damage response. Cells with a defective 9-1-1 complex have been shown to be sensitive to apoptosis induced by certain types of genotoxic stress. However, the mechanism linking the loss of a functional 9-1-1 complex to the cell death machinery has yet to be determined. Here, we report that etoposide treatment dramatically upregulates the BH3-only proteins, Bim and Puma, in Hus1-deficient cells. Inhibition of either Bim or Puma expression in Hus1-knockout cells confers significant resistance to etoposide-induced apoptosis, whereas knockdown of both proteins results in further resistance, suggesting that Bim and Puma cooperate in sensitizing Hus1-deficient cells to etoposide treatment. Moreover, we found that Rad9 collaborates with Bim and Puma to sensitize Hus1-deficient cells to etoposide-induced apoptosis. In response to DNA damage, Rad9 localizes to chromatin in Hus1-wild-type cells, whereas in Hus1-deficient cells, it is predominantly located in the cytoplasm where it binds to Bcl-2. Taken together, these results suggest that loss of Hus1 sensitizes cells to etoposide-induced apoptosis not only by inducing Bim and Puma expressions but also by releasing Rad9 into the cytosol to augment mitochondrial apoptosis.","18794804","VD","18794803","2"
"Characteristics and outcome of chronic myeloid leukemia patients with F317L BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation after therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","2008","Mutations in codon 317 after treatment with imatinib and dasatinib have been reported. We reviewed patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and mutations after tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. F317L was detected in 20, including 12/99 (12%) with mutation after imatinib failure, and 8/16 (50%) after dasatinib (P = .001). Median follow-up from mutation detection was 25 months. At the time of F317L, 8 patients were in chronic phase (CP), 6 in accelerated phase, and 6 in blast phase. There was no difference in characteristics between patients with or without F317L mutations, or with no mutations. A complete cytogenetic response was achieved in 3 of 6 patients treated with nilotinib, 2 of 2 with imatinib, and 0 of 3 with dasatinib. Survival of patients with F317L was similar to those with other mutations (P = .45). Patients in CP had better outcome, with a 2-year survival of 75%. F317L mutation is resistant to dasatinib but sensitive to other TKIs. The prognosis is dependent mostly on the disease stage.","18818391","IVD","18818391","1"
"Defective Notch activation in microenvironment leads to myeloproliferative disease.","2008","Despite the great importance of nonhematopoietic cells constituting the microenvironment for normal hematopoiesis, the cellular interactions between nonhematopoietic cells themselves are largely unknown. Using the Cre-loxP system in mice to inactivate Mind bomb-1 (Mib1), an essential component for Notch ligand endocytosis, here we show that the development of an MPD is dependent on defective Notch activation in the microenvironment. Our 2 independent Mib1 conditional knockout (CKO) mouse lines each developed a myeloproliferative disease (MPD), with gradual accumulations of immature granulocytes. The mutant mice showed hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, granulocytosis, and leukocyte infiltration in multiple organs and finally died at approximately 20 weeks of age. We were surprised to find that the transplantation of wild-type bone marrow cells into the Mib1-null microenvironment resulted in a de novo MPD. Moreover, by introducing the constitutively active intracellular domain of Notch1 in the Mib1-null background, we show that active Notch1 expression in the Mib1-null microenvironment significantly suppressed the disease progression, suggesting that the MPD development in the Mib1 CKO mice is due to defective Notch activation in the nonhematopoietic cells. These findings demonstrate that normal hematopoiesis absolutely requires Notch activation through the Notch ligand-receptor interaction between microenvironmental cells themselves and shed light on the microenvironment that fosters hematopoietic disorders.","18818392","IVD","18818391","2"
"K-ras mutations and benefit from cetuximab in advanced colorectal cancer.","2008","BACKGROUND. Treatment with cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor, improves overall and progression-free survival and preserves the quality of life in patients with colorectal cancer that has not responded to chemotherapy. The mutation status of the K-ras gene in the tumor may affect the response to cetuximab and have treatment-independent prognostic value. METHODS. We analyzed tumor samples, obtained from 394 of 572 patients (68.9%) with colorectal cancer who were randomly assigned to receive cetuximab plus best supportive care or best supportive care alone, to look for activating mutations in exon 2 of the K-ras gene. We assessed whether the mutation status of the K-ras gene was associated with survival in the cetuximab and supportive-care groups. RESULTS. Of the tumors evaluated for K-ras mutations, 42.3% had at least one mutation in exon 2 of the gene. The effectiveness of cetuximab was significantly associated with K-ras mutation status (P=0.01 and P<0.001 for the interaction of K-ras mutation status with overall survival and progression-free survival, respectively). In patients with wild-type K-ras tumors, treatment with cetuximab as compared with supportive care alone significantly improved overall survival (median, 9.5 vs. 4.8 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.74; P<0.001) and progression-free survival (median, 3.7 months vs. 1.9 months; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.54; P<0.001). Among patients with mutated K-ras tumors, there was no significant difference between those who were treated with cetuximab and those who received supportive care alone with respect to overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.98; P=0.89) or progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.99; P=0.96). In the group of patients receiving best supportive care alone, the mutation status of the K-ras gene was not significantly associated with overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 1.01; P=0.97). CONCLUSIONS. Patients with a colorectal tumor bearing mutated K-ras did not benefit from cetuximab, whereas patients with a tumor bearing wild-type K-ras did benefit from cetuximab. The mutation status of the K-ras gene had no influence on survival among patients treated with best supportive care alone. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00079066.)","18946061","IB","18946061","1"
"Toll-like receptor 4 polymorphisms and aspergillosis in stem-cell transplantation.","2008","BACKGROUND. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are essential components of the immune response to fungal pathogens. We examined the role of TLR polymorphisms in conferring a risk of invasive aspergillosis among recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplants. METHODS. We analyzed 20 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the toll-like receptor 2 gene (TLR2), the toll-like receptor 3 gene (TLR3), the toll-like receptor 4 gene (TLR4), and the toll-like receptor 9 gene (TLR9) in a cohort of 336 recipients of hematopoietic-cell transplants and their unrelated donors. The risk of invasive aspergillosis was assessed with the use of multivariate Cox regression analysis. The analysis was replicated in a validation study involving 103 case patients and 263 matched controls who received hematopoietic-cell transplants from related and unrelated donors. RESULTS. In the discovery study, two donor TLR4 haplotypes (S3 and S4) increased the risk of invasive aspergillosis (adjusted hazard ratio for S3, 2.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14 to 4.25; P=0.02; adjusted hazard ratio for S4, 6.16; 95% CI, 1.97 to 19.26; P=0.002). The haplotype S4 was present in carriers of two SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium (1063 A/G [D299G] and 1363 C/T [T399I]) that influence TLR4 function. In the validation study, donor haplotype S4 also increased the risk of invasive aspergillosis (adjusted odds ratio, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.15 to 5.41; P=0.02); the association was present in unrelated recipients of hematopoietic-cell transplants (odds ratio, 5.00; 95% CI, 1.04 to 24.01; P=0.04) but not in related recipients (odds ratio, 2.29; 95% CI, 0.93 to 5.68; P=0.07). In the discovery study, seropositivity for cytomegalovirus (CMV) in donors or recipients, donor positivity for S4, or both, as compared with negative results for CMV and S4, were associated with an increase in the 3-year probability of invasive aspergillosis (12% vs. 1%, P=0.02) and death that was not related to relapse (35% vs. 22%, P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS. This study suggests an association between the donor TLR4 haplotype S4 and the risk of invasive aspergillosis among recipients of hematopoietic-cell transplants from unrelated donors.","18946062","IB","18946061","2"
"KIT gene mutations and copy number in melanoma subtypes.","2008","PURPOSE. We recently identified a KIT exon 11 mutation in an anorectal melanoma of a patient who had an excellent response to treatment with imatinib. To determine the frequency of KIT mutations across melanoma subtypes, we surveyed a large series of tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. One hundred eighty-nine melanomas were screened for mutations in KIT exons 11, 13, and 17. KIT copy number was assessed by quantitative PCR. A subset of cases was evaluated for BRAF and NRAS mutations. Immunohistochemistry was done to assess KIT (CD117) expression. RESULTS. KIT mutations were detected in 23% (3 of 13) of acral melanomas, 15.6% (7 of 45) of mucosal melanomas, 7.7% (1 of 13) of conjunctival melanomas, 1.7% (1 of 58) of cutaneous melanomas, and 0% (0 of 60) of choroidal melanomas. Almost all the KIT mutations were of the type predicted to be imatinib sensitive. There was no overlap with NRAS mutations (11.1% of acral and 24.3% of mucosal tumors) or with BRAF mutations (absent in mucosal tumors). Increased KIT copy number was detected in 27.3% (3 of 11) of acral and 26.3% (10 of 38) of mucosal melanomas, but was less common among cutaneous (6.7%; 3 of 45), conjunctival (7.1%; 1 of 14), and choroidal melanomas (0 of 28). CD117 expression, present in 39% of 105 tumors representing all melanoma types, did not correlate with either KIT mutation status or KIT copy number. CONCLUSIONS. Our findings confirm that KIT mutations are most common in acral and mucosal melanomas but do not necessarily correlate with KIT copy number or CD117 expression. Screening for KIT mutations may open up new treatment options for melanoma patients.","18980976","IVD","18980976","1"
"Recurrence of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder: a role for insulin-like growth factor-II loss of imprinting and cytoplasmic E-cadherin immunolocalization.","2008","PURPOSE. This study documents the frequency of insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) loss of imprinting (LOI) in a series of 87 bladder tissues. E-cadherin (CDH1) immunolocalization was also investigated due to the known redistribution of this adherence protein to the cytoplasm following exogenous exposure to IGF-II. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. Informative IGF-II cases were identified following DNA-PCR amplification and subsequent sequencing of the transcribable ApaI RFLP in exon 9 of IGF-II. Similar approaches using primer-specific cDNA templates identified the imprinting status of IGF-II in these informative cases. CDH1 cellular localization was assessed on a tissue microarray platform of 114 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) cases (70 pT(a) noninvasive and 44 pT(1) lamina propria invasive) using the commercially available Novocastra antibody. RESULTS. IGF-II LOI was evident in 7 of 17 (41%) UCB tumors and 4 of 11 (36%) tumor-associated normal urothelial samples. Two of four pT(1) grade 3 tumors, the subject of much debate concerning their suitability for radical cystectomy, showed LOI at the IGF-II locus. In those tumors showing IGF-II LOI, 4 of 7 (57%) displayed concomitant CDH1 cytoplasmic staining. In contrast, only 3 of 10 (30%) IGF-II maintenance of imprinting tumors had concomitant CDH1 cytoplasmic localization. UCB cell lines displaying cytoplasmic CDH1 immunolocalization expressed significantly higher levels of IGF-II (CAL29, HT1376, and RT112) compared with RT4, a cell line displaying crisp membranous CDH1 staining. Finally, cytoplasmic CDH1 staining was an independent predictor of a shorter time to recurrence independent of tumor grade and stage. CONCLUSIONS. We suggest that CDH1 cytoplasmic immunolocalization as a result of increased IGF-II levels identifies those nonmuscle invasive presentations most likely to recur and therefore might benefit from more radical nonconserving bladder surgery.","18980977","IVD","18980976","2"
"Novel and existing mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor are predictors of optimal resectability in malignant peritoneal mesothelioma.","2009","Malignant peritoneal mesotheliomas (MPM) are rare tumors representing 20% of all malignant mesothelioma cases. The median survival for these tumors is less than a year, and like other peritoneal surface malignancies, this is due primarily to intra-abdominal recurrence and progression. Currently there is a paucity of information about the biology of these tumors and molecular perturbations that are involved in tumor formation. Elucidation of mutations and biological pathways active in these tumors may identify valuable prognostic markers, as well as facilitate the development of novel therapies. In this study, we investigate the predictive value of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in achieving optimal resectability. Twenty-nine patients with MPM were evaluated at a single tertiary care center and their tumors were probed for point mutations in the catalytic TK domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (mut+). All specimens were examined for somatic mutations by polymerase chain reaction amplification, and all variants were confirmed by multiple independent amplifications. Twenty-five patients were treated with cytoreductive surgery with or without intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy and complete clinical data including age, sex, cytoreductive score, mutation, and survival were available for comparison of the mut+ and mut- groups. The median age was 56 years, 71% of the patients were male, and the median follow-up time was 14.5 months. Mutations were found in 31% (9 of 29) of the tumors. Seven of these mutations were novel, and one was the L858R mutation described in non-small-cell lung cancer. Of the 25 patients managed surgically, 7 had mut+ and 18 wild type (mut-) disease. Optimal resectability was achieved in 7 (100%) of 7 of mut+ group and 9 (50%) of 18 mut- (p = .026). All mut+ patients are alive with a mean follow-up time of 24 months, whereas 5 (28%) of 18 of the mut- group are dead of disease with a mean follow-up time of 7 months (p = .27). In an analysis of covariance model, only optimal resectability (p = .04) was found to be predictive of survival. EGFR-TK seems to be a common site for mutation in MPM, with mutations being identified in 31% of patients. The EGFR mutations identified included the L858R activating mutation, as well as eight novel EGFR-TK catalytic domain point mutations. These mutations were predictive of optimal resectability, which was the only variable found to be predictive of survival. With longer follow-up, mut+ may not only be predictive of survival but may represent a subset of patients whose disease may be responsive to TK-inhibitor therapy. Experiments confirming the activating properties of the novel mutations are warranted.","18998063","IVD","18998063","1"
"Disparities in receipt of lymph node biopsy among early-stage female breast cancer patients.","2009","Accurate staging of early breast cancer requires pathological assessment of axillary lymph node involvement. We evaluated the proportion of women receiving surgery for early-stage breast cancer who do not receive any lymph node biopsy (LNB) and factors associated with not receiving LNB. Patients receiving surgery for early-stage breast cancer (T1a/T1b/T1c/T2N0) during the period 2003-2005 were selected from the National Cancer Database. Patient sociodemographic, clinical, health insurance, and facility information was collected. Logistic regression was used to assess factors predictive of not receiving LNB. The number of women meeting study inclusion criteria was 184,050, 11% of whom did not receive any LNB. Compared with White patients, Black patients had greater likelihood [odds ratio (OR) 1.10, p<0.001] of receiving no LNB; there were no significant differences for Hispanic or other non-White patients. Individuals who were uninsured (OR 1.24, p<0.0005) or covered by Medicare at age <65 years (OR 1.29, p<0.0001) had greater likelihoods of no LNB compared with those with private insurance. Medicaid patients and Medicare patients >or= 65 years were not significantly different from private insurance patients. Compared with the youngest quartile of patients (age <or= 51 years), patients in the oldest quartile (age >or=73 years) were more than three times as likely (OR 3.30, p<0.0001) not to receive any LNB. We conclude that, while guidelines indicate that LNB may be considered optional in certain patient groups, it remains a key component in determining stage, and thereby prognosis and appropriate treatment options. These results indicate that significant disparities exist in sampling of axillary lymph nodes among women with early-stage breast cancer.","18998064","IVD","18998063","2"
"Analysis of c-KIT expression and KIT gene mutation in human mucosal melanomas.","2008","Recent data suggested an increased frequency of KIT aberrations in mucosal melanomas, whereas c-KIT in most types of cutaneous melanomas does not appear to be of pathogenetic importance. However, studies investigating the status of the KIT gene in larger, well-characterised groups of patients with mucosal melanomas are lacking. We analysed 44 archival specimens of 39 well-characterised patients with mucosal melanomas of different locations. c-KIT protein expression was determined by immunhistochemistry, KIT gene mutations were analysed by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing of exons 9, 11, 13, 17 and 18. c-KIT protein expression could be shown in 40 out of 44 (91%) tumours in at least 10% of tumour cells. DNA sequence analysis of the KIT was successfully performed in 37 patients. In 6 out of 37 patients (16%) KIT mutations were found, five in exon 11 and one in exon 18. The presence of mutations in exon 11 correlated with a significant stronger immunohistochemical expression of c-KIT protein (P=0.015). Among the six patients with mutations, in two patients the primary tumour was located in the head/neck region, in three patients in the genitourinary tract and in one patient in the anal/rectal area. In conclusion, KIT mutations can be found in a subset of patients with mucosal melanomas irrespective of the location of the primary tumour. Our data encourage therapeutic attempts with tyrosine kinase inhibitors blocking c-KIT in these patients.","19018266","IVD","19018266","1"
"KRAS or BRAF mutation status is a useful predictor of sensitivity to MEK inhibition in ovarian cancer.","2008","This study examined the status of KRAS and BRAF mutations, in relation to extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) activation in 58 ovarian carcinomas to clarify the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of KRAS/BRAF mutations. Somatic mutations of either KRAS or BRAF were identified in 12 (20.6%) out of 58 ovarian carcinomas. The frequency of KRAS/BRAF mutations in conventional serous high-grade carcinomas (4.0% : 1/25) was significantly lower than that in the other histological type (32.3% : 10/31). Phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) expression was identified in 18 (38.2%) out of 45 ovarian carcinomas. KRAS/BRAF mutation was significantly correlated with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I, II (P<0.001), and p-ERK1/2 (P<0.001). No significant correlations between KRAS/BRAF mutations or p-ERK1/2 expression and overall survival were found in patients with ovarian carcinoma treated with platinum and taxane chemotherapy (P=0.2460, P=0.9339, respectively). Next, to clarify the roles of ERK1/2 activation in ovarian cancers harbouring KRAS or BRAF mutations, we inactivated ERK1/2 in ovarian cancer cells using CI-1040. Cl-1040 is a compound that selectively inhibits MAP kinase kinase (MEK), an upstream regulator of ERK1/2, and thus prevents ERK1/2 activation. Profound growth inhibition and apoptosis were observed in CI-1040-treated cancer cells with mutations in either KRAS or BRAF in comparison with the ovarian cancer cells containing wild-type sequences. This was evident in both in vitro and in vivo studies. The findings in this study indicate that an activated ERK1/2 pathway is critical to tumour growth and survival of ovarian cancers with KRAS or BRAF mutations. Furthermore, they suggest that the CI-1040-induced phenotypes depend on the mutational status of KRAS and BRAF in ovarian cancers. Therefore, ovarian cancer patients with KRAS or BRAF mutations may benefit from CI-1040 treatment.","19018267","IVD","19018266","2"

The frequency of KRAS/BRAF mutations in conventional serous high-grade carcinomas (4.0% : 1/25) was significantly lower than that in the other histological type (32.3% : 10/31). Phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) expression was identified in 18 (38.2%) out of 45 ovarian carcinomas. KRAS/BRAF mutation was significantly correlated with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I, II (P<0.001), and p-ERK1/2 (P<0.001). No significant correlations between KRAS/BRAF mutations or p-ERK1/2 expression and overall survival were found in patients with ovarian carcinoma treated with platinum and taxane chemotherapy (P=0.2460, P=0.9339, respectively). Next, to clarify the roles of ERK1/2 activation in ovarian cancers harbouring KRAS or BRAF mutations, we inactivated ERK1/2 in ovarian cancer cells using CI-1040. Cl-1040 is a compound that selectively inhibits MAP kinase kinase (MEK), an upstream regulator of ERK1/2, and thus prevents ERK1/2 activation. Profound growth inhibition and apoptosis were observed in CI-1040-treated cancer cells with mutations in either KRAS or BRAF in comparison with the ovarian cancer cells containing wild-type sequences. This was evident in both in vitro and in vivo studies. The findings in this study indicate that an activated ERK1/2 pathway is critical to tumour growth and survival of ovarian cancers with KRAS or BRAF mutations. Furthermore, they suggest that the CI-1040-induced phenotypes depend on the mutational status of KRAS and BRAF in ovarian cancers. Therefore, ovarian cancer patients with KRAS or BRAF mutations may benefit from CI-1040 treatment.","19018267","VD","19018267","1"
"Ambivalent aspects of interleukin-6 in cerebral ischemia: inflammatory versus neurotrophic aspects.","2009","Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is pleiotropic cytokine involved in many central nervous system disorders including stroke, and elevated serum IL-6 has been found in acute stroke patients. IL-6 is implicated in the inflammation, which contributes to both injury and repair process after cerebral ischemia. However, IL-6 is one of the neurotrophic cytokines sharing a common receptor subunit, gp130, with other neurotrophic cytokines, such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor. The expression of IL-6 is most prominently identified in neurons in the peri-ischemic regions, and LIF expression shows a similar pattern. The direct injection of these cytokines into the brain after ischemia can reduce ischemic brain injury. The cytokine receptors are localized on the neuron surface, suggesting that neurons are the cytokine target. The major IL-6 downstream signaling pathway is JAK-STAT, and Stat3 activation occurs mainly in neurons during postischemic reperfusion. Further investigation is necessary to clarify the exact role of Stat3 signaling in neuroprotection. Taken together, the information suggests that IL-6 plays a double role in cerebral ischemia, as an inflammatory mediator during the acute phase and as a neurotrophic mediator between the subacute and prolonged phases.","19018268","VD","19018267","2"
"Effective use of PI3K and MEK inhibitors to treat mutant Kras G12D and PIK3CA H1047R murine lung cancers.","2008","Somatic mutations that activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) have been identified in the p110-alpha catalytic subunit (encoded by PIK3CA).

Although the p110-alpha mutants are transforming in vitro, their oncogenic potential has not been assessed in genetically engineered mouse models. Furthermore, clinical trials with PI3K inhibitors have recently been initiated, and it is unknown if their efficacy will be restricted to specific, genetically defined malignancies. In this study, we engineered a mouse model of lung adenocarcinomas initiated and maintained by expression of p110-alpha H1047R. Treatment of these tumors with NVP-BEZ235, a dual pan-PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor in clinical development, led to marked tumor regression as shown by positron emission tomography-computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and microscopic examination. In contrast, mouse lung cancers driven by mutant Kras did not substantially respond to single-agent NVP-BEZ235. However, when NVP-BEZ235 was combined with a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, ARRY-142886, there was marked synergy in shrinking these Kras-mutant cancers. These in vivo studies suggest that inhibitors of the PI3K-mTOR pathway may be active in cancers with PIK3CA mutations and, when combined with MEK inhibitors, may effectively treat KRAS mutated lung cancers.","19029981","IVD","19029981","1"

Here we show that intramuscular expression in the mouse of an inducible transgene encoding constitutively active ALK2 (caALK2), resulting from a glutamine to aspartic acid change at amino acid position 207, leads to ectopic endochondral bone formation, joint fusion and functional impairment, thus phenocopying key aspects of human FOP. A selective inhibitor of BMP type I receptor kinases, LDN-193189 (ref. 6), inhibits activation of the BMP signaling effectors SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8 in tissues expressing caALK2 induced by adenovirus specifying Cre (Ad.Cre). This treatment resulted in a reduction in ectopic ossification and functional impairment. In contrast to localized induction of caALK2 by Ad.Cre (which entails inflammation), global postnatal expression of caALK2 (induced without the use of Ad.Cre and thus without inflammation) does not lead to ectopic ossification. However, if in this context an inflammatory stimulus was provided with a control adenovirus, ectopic bone formation was induced. Like LDN-193189, corticosteroid inhibits ossification in Ad.Cre-injected mutant mice, suggesting caALK2 expression and an inflammatory milieu are both required for the development of ectopic ossification in this model. These results support the role of dysregulated ALK2 kinase activity in the pathogenesis of FOP and suggest that small molecule inhibition of BMP type I receptor activity may be useful in treating FOP and heterotopic ossification syndromes associated with excessive BMP signaling.","19029982","IVD","19029981","2"

"Prognostic implication of EGFR, KRAS, and TP53 gene mutations in a large cohort of Japanese patients with surgically treated lung adenocarcinoma.","2009","INTRODUCTION. Although mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene is predictive for the response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, its prognostic impact for patients without EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment remains controversial. We examined for EGFR, KRAS or TP53 mutations in a consecutive large cohort of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, and evaluated their prognostic impact. METHODS. We analyzed 397 patients with lung adenocarcinoma who underwent potentially curative pulmonary resection. Total ribonucleic acid was extracted and direct sequencing of each gene was performed after reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS. We found that 196 patients (49%) had EGFR mutations. Of these, 83 were exon 19 deletions (42%) and 92 were L858R (47%). Univariate analysis showed that patients with EGFR mutations survived for a longer period than those without mutations (p = 0.0046). However, there was no difference in overall survival between the patients with exon 19 deletion and those with L858R (p = 0.4144). Patients with KRAS mutations or TP53 mutations tended to survive for a shorter period (p = 0.2183 and 0.0230, respectively). Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model revealed that smoking status (p = 0.0310) and disease stage (p < 0.0001) were independent prognostic factors. However, none of the gene mutations was independent prognostic factors (EGFR, p = 0.3225; KRAS, p = 0.8500; TP53, p = 0.3191). CONCLUSIONS. EGFR, KRAS, and TP53 gene mutations were not independently associated with the prognosis for Japanese patients with surgically treated lung adenocarcinoma.","19096302","IVD","19096302","1"
"Preliminary investigation of the clinical significance of detecting circulating tumor cells enriched from lung cancer patients.","2009","BACKGROUND. Enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may be valuable for lung cancer treatment and monitoring cancer patient relapse. In the present study we report clinical significance of lung cancer CTC. METHODS. CTCs were enriched from peripheral blood of 47 lung cancer patients by means of a modified enrichment strategy, followed by identification with immunofluorescence staining using anticytokeratins 18 and 19 monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS. A control group consisted of 18 healthy donors and 13 nonmalignant pulmonary tuberculosis patients had no positive subject detected. Among 41 newly diagnosed and 6 recurrent lung cancer patients (3 stage I-II, 22 stage III and 22 stage IV) including 27 adenocarcinoma (ADC), 7 squamous cell carcinoma and 13 small cell lung cancer (SCLC), positive detection rate of newly diagnosed patients with CTC >/=2/7.5 ml blood was 78% (ADC stage III), 75% (squamous cell carcinoma stage III) and 60% (SCLC stage III), respectively. Whereas 46% (ADC IV) and 71% (SCLC IV) were observed for stage IV patients. Recurrent patients showed highest detection sensitivity of 83%. A small scale follow-up study was performed on 12 patients following 2 courses of first line chemotherapy. This demonstrated a good correlation of CTC enumeration with radiographic response. CONCLUSIONS. Results of the present study suggest potential clinical utilities of CTC enumeration on lung cancer patients in terms of rapid evaluation of chemotherapy effect in real time and monitoring lung cancer recurrence. A large scale of study which is necessary for further validation of the significance of lung cancer CTC is being performed.","19096303","IVD","19096302","2"
"HER2YVMA drives rapid development of adenosquamous lung tumors in mice that are sensitive to BIBW2992 and rapamycin combination therapy.","2009","Mutations in the HER2 kinase domain have been identified in human clinical lung cancer specimens. Here we demonstrate that inducible expression of the most common HER2 mutant (HER2(YVMA)) in mouse lung epithelium causes invasive adenosquamous carcinomas restricted to proximal and distal bronchioles. Continuous expression of HER2(YVMA) is essential for tumor maintenance, suggesting a key role for HER2 in lung adenosquamous tumorigenesis. Preclinical studies assessing the in vivo effect of erlotinib, trastuzumab, BIBW2992, and/or rapamycin on HER2(YVMA) transgenic mice or H1781 xenografts with documented tumor burden revealed that the combination of BIBW2992 and rapamycin is the most effective treatment paradigm causing significant tumor shrinkage. Immunohistochemical analysis of lung tumors treated with BIBW2992 and rapamycin combination revealed decreased phosphorylation levels for proteins in both upstream and downstream arms of MAPK and Akt/mTOR signaling axes, indicating inhibition of these pathways. Based on these findings, clinical testing of the BIBW2992/rapamycin combination in non-small cell lung cancer patients with tumors expressing HER2 mutations is warranted.","19122144","IVD","19122144","1"
"Direct imaging of human Rad51 nucleoprotein dynamics on individual DNA molecules.","2009","Rad51 protein (Rad51) is central to recombinational repair of double-strand DNA breaks. It polymerizes onto DNA and promotes strand exchange between homologous chromosomes. We visualized the real-time assembly and disassembly of human Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments on double-stranded DNA by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. Rad51 assembly extends the DNA by approximately 65%. Nucleoprotein filament formation occurs via rapid nucleation followed by growth from these nuclei. Growth does not continue indefinitely, however, and nucleoprotein filaments terminate when approximately 2 mum in length. The dependence of nascent filament formation on Rad51 concentration suggests that 2-3 Rad51 monomers are involved in nucleation. Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments are stable and remain extended when ATP hydrolysis is prevented; however, when permitted, filaments decrease in length as a result of conversion to ADP-bound nucleoprotein complexes and partial protein dissociation. Dissociation of Rad51 from dsDNA is slow and incomplete, thereby rationalizing the need for other proteins that facilitate disassembly.","19122145","IVD","19122144","2"
"Mutation of PIK3CA: possible risk factor for cervical carcinogenesis in older women.","2009","PIK3CA encodes the p110alpha catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, which regulates signaling pathways important for neoplasia, cell proliferation and apoptosis. Somatic mutations in this gene have been detected in several solid human tumors. We investigated these mutations in cervical carcinoma and its precursors, and their association with HPV infection and patient clinical data. The mutations were analyzed using post-PCR direct genomic DNA sequencing. Samples included 9 cervical cancer cell lines, 184 invasive cervical carcinomas, and 30 cervical neoplasias. Missense mutations of PIK3CA were identified in 15/184 (8.15%) invasive cervical carcinomas. One novel mutation G1638C (Q546H) was found. Three mutations were identified in the cervical cancer lines. No mutations were found in the precursors. The difference in mutation frequency between invasive and pre-invasive lesions was not significant (p=0.1372). In relation to age and HPV, the mutation rate was significantly higher in patients>or=60 years (p=0.001), while the rate of HPV infection was higher in patients<or=60 years (p=0.025). No significant correlation with other clinicopathological data was found. The results suggest that PIK3CA mutations are a late event and uncommon in the progression of malignant tumors, but it appears that they facilitate carcinogenesis in older women.","19148475","IVD","19148475","1"
"Delineation of yet unknown cryptic subtelomere aberrations in 50% of acute myeloid leukemia with normal GTG-banding karyotype.","2009","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease with respect to clinical prognosis and acquired chromosomal aberrations. After routine banding cytogenetic analysis 45% of AML patients show a normal karyotype (NK-AML). For a better understanding of development and progression in AML, it is important to find markers which could be primary genetic aberrations. Therefore, in this study 31 patients with NK-AML were analyzed by new high resolution molecular cytogenetic approaches. A combination of multitude multicolor banding and metaphase microdissection-based comparative genomic hybridization revealed deletions of the subtelomeric regions in 6% of the studied cases. According to these results, locus-specific probes for the subtelomeric regions of chromosomes 5, 9, 11, 12 and 13 were applied on 22 of the studied 31 NK-AML cases. Surprisingly, 50% of them showed deletions or duplications. These aberrations occurred in the in vitro proliferating as well as in the non-proliferating cells. Meta-analysis of the aberrant regions revealed that they often include genes known to be associated with tumors, e.g. RASA3 on chromosome 13. These results implicate that aberrations in the subtelomeric regions of NK-AML occur quite often and may be considered as primary genetic changes, and should not be neglected in future diagnostic approaches.","19148476","IVD","19148475","2"
"Phase II study of imatinib mesylate as therapy for patients with systemic mastocytosis.","2009","Gain-of-function D816V point mutation within the kinase domain of the transmembrane receptor KIT is found in the great majority of patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM) and is attractive therapeutic target. Twenty patients with SM were enrolled during 2003-2005 in phase II clinical trial with imatinib mesylate (400mg daily), a KIT inhibitor. Median time on therapy was 9 months (range, 0.5-44+). Only one patient, with D816V KIT mutation-negative FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha-negative SM-HES, achieved complete remission (now lasting for 44 months). Six other patients reported symptomatic improvement, including two with D816V KIT mutation-positive SM (one reported improvement in diarrhea and the other in fatigue). Other patients had no benefit. Imatinib was relatively well tolerated. Our study confirms that imatinib therapy does not result in appreciable clinical activity in patients with D816V mutation-positive SM, but may result in a significant benefit in occasional patient with D816V mutation-negative SM.","19193436","IB","19193436","1"
"Subcellular compartmentalization of lead in the earthworm, Eisenia fetida: Relationship to survival and reproduction.","2009","Metals are detoxified and sequestered into subcellular compartments when accumulated by earthworms. Differential centrifugation was used to quantify subcellular Pb in three separate studies to measure 14-day acute toxicity (lethality), 28/56-day reproductive effects, and 90-day bioaccumulation in spiked-soil exposed earthworms, Eisenia fetida. Observed toxicity and total body Pb was consistent with published work of others. Pb showed concentration-dependent toxicity relationships (lethality and reproduction) for total and subcellular Pb. Toxic fraction and total Pb showed similar concentration-response patterns in the 14-day and 28/56-day studies and tended to increase towards a plateau at higher concentrations. Linear correlations of subcellular to total Pb was observed in all studies except the 90-day bioaccumulation study in which toxic fraction Pb appeared to approach a maximum over the period between Day 56 and Day 90. In a follow-on study using two different contaminated soil types, toxic fraction and total Pb concentrations as related to reproductive effects were consistent with data from our spiked soil studies, and this suggests it may be possible to use such values to ""factor out"" matrix-specific influences that otherwise skew toxicity values when expressed relative to soil concentrations. Our findings, however, suggest the subcellular fractionation approach may not offer advantages over total Pb determination in short-term exposure studies but may become important when longer exposure periods (greater than 90 days) are considered. In this respect, the technique we describe has the potential to provide valuable information for assessing and interpreting Pb toxicity as a function of earthworm body burden.","19193437","IB","19193436","2"

"Correlation of RET somatic mutations with clinicopathological features in sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas.","2009","Screening of REarranged during Transfection (RET) gene mutations has been carried out in different series of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC). RET-positive tumours seem to be associated to a worse clinical outcome. However, the correlation between the type of RET mutation and the patients' clinicopathological data has not been evaluated yet. We analysed RET exons 5, 8, 10-16 in fifty-one sporadic MTC, and found somatic mutations in thirty-three (64.7%) tumours. Among the RET-positive cases, exon 16 was the most frequently affected (60.6%). Two novel somatic mutations (Cys630Gly, c.1881del18) were identified. MTC patients were divided into three groups: group 1, with mutations in RET exons 15 and 16; group 2, with other RET mutations; group 3, having no RET mutations. Group 1 had higher prevalence (P=0.0051) and number of lymph node metastases (P=0.0017), and presented more often multifocal tumours (P=0.037) and persistent disease at last control (P=0.0242) than group 2. Detectable serum calcitonin levels at last screening (P=0.0119) and stage IV disease (P=0.0145) were more frequent in group 1, than in the other groups. Our results suggest that, among the sporadic MTC, cases with RET mutations in exons 15 and 16 are associated with the worst prognosis. Cases with other RET mutations have the most indolent course, and those with no RET mutations have an intermediate risk.","19401695","IIC","19401695","1"
"Clinical benefit in Phase-I trials of novel molecularly targeted agents: does dose matter?","2009","Phase-I trials traditionally involve dose-escalation to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD). With conventional chemotherapy, efficacy is generally deemed to be dose-dependent, but the same may not be applicable to molecularly targeted agents (MTAs). We analysed consecutive patients included in Phase-I trials at the Royal Marsden Hospital from 5 January 2005 to 6 June 2006. We considered only trials of monotherapy MTAs in which the MTD was defined. Three patient cohorts (A, B, and C) were identified according to the dose received as a percentage of the final trial MTD (0-33%, 34-65%, >66%). Potential efficacy was assessed using the non-progression rate (NPR), that is, complete/partial response or stable disease for at least 3 months by RECIST. A total of 135 patients having progressive disease before enrolment were analysed from 15 eligible trials. Median age was 57 years (20-86); male : female ratio was 1.8 : 1. Cohort A, B, and C included 28 (21%), 22 (16%), and 85 (63%) patients; NPR at 3 and 6 months was 21% and 11% (A), 50% and 27% (B), 31% and 14% (C), respectively, P=0.9. Median duration of non-progression (17 weeks; 95% CI=13-22) was not correlated with the MTD level, P=0.9.

However, there is little data on these mutations in breast precursor lesions. To further delineate the molecular evolution of breast tumorigenesis, samples of invasive breast carcinoma with an accompanying in situ component were macro dissected from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue and screened for mutations in PIK3CA exons 7, 9, 20, and AKT1 exon 2. Laser capture micro dissection (LCM) was performed on mutation-positive carcinomas to directly compare the genotypes of separated invasive and in situ tumor cells. Among 81 cases of invasive carcinoma, there were eight mutations in PIK3CA exon 20 (7 H1047R, 1 H1047L) and four mutations in exon 9 (2 E545K, 1 E542K, 1 E545G), totaling 12/81 (14.8%). In 11 cases examined, paired LCM in situ tumor showed the identical PIK3CA mutation in invasive and in situ carcinoma. Likewise, 3 of 78 (3.8%) invasive carcinomas showed an AKT1 E17K mutation, and this mutation was identified in matching in situ carcinoma in both informative cases. Mutational status did not correlate with clinical parameters including hormone receptor status, grade, and lymph node status. The complete concordance of PIK3CA and AKT1 mutations in matched samples of invasive and in situ tumor indicates that these mutations occur early in breast cancer development and has implications with regard to therapeutics targeted to the PI3 kinase pathway.","19418217","IVD","19418217","1"
"The role and regulation of the nuclear receptor co-activator AIB1 in breast cancer.","2009","AIB1 (amplified in breast cancer 1), also called SRC-3 and NCoA-3, is a member of the p160 nuclear receptor co-activator family and is considered an important oncogene in breast cancer. Increased AIB1 levels in human breast cancer have been correlated with poor clinical prognosis. Overexpression of AIB1 in conjunction with members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF/HER) tyrosine kinase family, such as HER2, is associated with resistance to tamoxifen therapy and decreased disease-free survival. A number of functional studies in cell culture and in rodents indicate that AIB1 has a pleiotropic role in breast cancer. Initially AIB1 was shown to have a role in the estrogen-dependent proliferation of breast epithelial cells. However, AIB1 also affects the growth of hormone-independent breast cancer and AIB1 levels are limiting for IGF-1-, EGF- and heregulin-stimulated biological responses in breast cancer cells and consequently the PI3 K/Akt/mTOR and other EGFR/HER2 signaling pathways are controlled by changes in AIB1 protein levels. The cellular levels and activity of AIB1 are in turn regulated at the levels of transcription, mRNA stability, post-translational modification, and by a complex control of protein half life. In particular, AIB1 activity as well as its half-life is modulated through a number of post-translational modifications including serine, threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation via kinases that are components of multiple signal transduction pathways. This review summarizes the possible mechanisms of how dysregulation of AIB1 at multiple levels can lead to the initiation and progression of breast cancer as well as its role as a predictor of response to breast cancer therapy, and as a possible therapeutic target.","19418218","IVD","19418217","2"
"A novel dual PI3Kalpha/mTOR inhibitor PI-103 with high antitumor activity in non-small cell lung cancer cells.","2009","PI-103, the first synthetic multitargeted compound which simultaneously inhibits PI3Kalpha and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) shows high antitumor activity in glioma xenografts. In the present study, clear antitumor activity was observed with PI-103 treatment in two gefitinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, A549 and H460, by simultaneously inhibiting p70s6k phosporylation and Akt phosphorylation in response to mTOR inhibition. In addition, H460 cells with activating mutations of PIK3CA were more sensitive to PI-103 than A549 cells with wild-type PIK3CA. PI-103 was found to inhibit growth by causing G0-G1 arrest in A549 and H460 cells. Western blotting showed that PI-103 induced down-regulation of cyclin D1 and E1 and simultaneously up-regulated p21 and p27, associated with arrest in the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, p53, the tumor suppressor which transcriptionally regulates p21, was also upregulated with PI-103 treatment. Collectively, our results suggest that multitargeted intervention is the most effective tumor therapy, and the cooperative blockade of PI3Kalpha and mTOR with PI-103 shows promise for treating gefitinib-resistant NSCLC.","19513541","IVD","19513541","1"
"Conditional expression of type 2 angiotensin II receptor in rat vascular smooth muscle cells reveals the interplay of the angiotensin system in matrix metalloproteinase 2 expression and vascular remodeling.","2009","Angiotensin II is well implicated in neointimal proliferation and the resulting restenosis, however, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. The type 2 angiotensin II (AT2) receptor, largely unexpressed in the adult vasculature, however, appears at significant levels after vascular injury. To investigate the specific contribution of AT2 receptor and the interplay of the angiotensin system to neointima, we engineered rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to express the AT2 receptor in a tetracycline-regulated system. Several VSMC clones resistant to both hygromycin and G418 were selected, many of which showed high, but regulatable levels of AT2R expression within 48 h of doxycycline (Dox) exposure. In untransfected VSMCs and stable transfectants with no AT2R induction, Ang II significantly increased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), which is linked to neointimal growth. However, induction of AT2R by Dox addition markedly decreased MMP-2 levels (P<0.01) and this downregulation was further promoted by CV-11974, a specific antagonist of AT1 receptor. In contrast, the PD123319 compound, which selectively curtails the AT2 receptor, reversed the inhibition caused by CV-11974. We conclude that Ang II enhances the MMP-2 expression via AT1R, and that enforces AT2R inhibited the same. These data confirm that AT2R functions to downregulate the effects elicited by Ang II + AT1R signaling and point to the role of MMP and extracellular matrix in vascular injury.

"Phase II study of safety and efficacy of motesanib in patients with progressive or symptomatic, advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer.","2009","PURPOSE. This phase II study investigated the efficacy and tolerability of motesanib, an investigational, highly selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3; platelet-derived growth factor receptor; and Kit in advanced medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). PATIENTS AND METHODS. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic, progressive or symptomatic MTC received motesanib 125 mg/d orally for up to 48 weeks or until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The primary end point was objective response by independent review. Other end points included duration of response, progression-free survival, safety, pharmacokinetics, and changes in tumor markers. RESULTS. Of 91 enrolled patients who received motesanib, two (2%) achieved objective response (95% CI, 0.3% to 7.7%); their duration of response was 32 weeks (censored) and 21 weeks (disease progressed). Eighty-one percent of patients had stable disease (48% had durable stable disease > or = 24 weeks), 8% had disease progression as best response, and 9% were not evaluated; 76% experienced a decrease from baseline in target lesion measurement. Median progression-free survival was 48 weeks (95% CI, 43 to 56 weeks). Among patients with tumor marker analysis, 69 (83%) of 83 and 63 (75%) of 84 had decreased serum calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen during treatment, respectively, compared with baseline. The most common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea (41%), fatigue (41%), hypothyroidism (29%), hypertension (27%), and anorexia (27%). In pharmacokinetic analyses, motesanib trough concentrations were lower compared with differentiated thyroid cancer patients from the same study. CONCLUSION. Although the objective response rate was low, a significant proportion of MTC patients (81%) achieved stable disease while receiving motesanib.","19564535","IA","19564535","1"
"Improving the methodologic and ethical validity of best supportive care studies in oncology: lessons from a systematic review.","2009","PURPOSE. To systematically review the best supportive care (BSC) literature and to evaluate the ethical and methodologic validity issues by using widely acknowledged criteria. METHODS. Two search strings that included both cancer and supportive as terms (with random article type, or review or meta-analysis) explored databases from 1966 to 2008. Citations, abstracts, and papers were reviewed for inclusion criteria, and relevant data were extracted by two independent researchers. Data were validated for accuracy. Ethical and methodologic validity were evaluated by using the criteria derived from the Helsinki Requirements of the WMA; CONSORT statements for the evaluation of reports of randomized, controlled trials; and the universal requirements for ethical clinical research. RESULTS. Forty-three published papers were identified that described 32 studies, 20 of which incorporated the design of treatment plus supportive care (SC) versus SC alone, and 12 of which incorporated the design of treatment versus SC. Most of the studies had poor compliance to critical Helsinki requirements, to methodologic precautions derived from the CONSORT statement for studies involving a nonpharmacologic arm, and to four of seven universal requirements for ethical clinical research. CONCLUSION. Lack of rigor in BSC studies has contributed to a generation of research with widespread ethical and methodologic shortcomings. Ad hoc SC and lack of standardization of SC delivery may be sources of systematic bias or error in BSC trials. Rectifying these shortcomings in future studies demands greater vigilance toward these issues by researchers, institutional review boards, editors, and peer reviewers. Given the prevalence of overlooked problems that are later identified, currently open BSC studies should be reevaluated by institutional review boards and researchers to check for ethical and methodologic validity, and identified shortcomings should be addressed.","19564538","IA","19564535","2"
"Long-term outcome of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia treated with second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors after imatinib failure is predicted by the in vitro sensitivity of BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations.","2009","Secondary imatinib resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is associated in approximately 50% of cases with mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain, necessitating switch to one of several new tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that act differentially on mutated BCR-ABL. We assess here whether scoring mutation based on in vitro inhibitory concentration of each TKI-mutation pair can predict long-term clinical outcome. Among 169 patients with CML after imatinib failure, mutations were detected before TKI switch in 41 (48%) treated with dasatinib and 45 (52%) treated with nilotinib. Inhibitory concentration values for each TKI-mutation pair were stratified into high (n = 42), intermediate (n = 25), low (T315I, n = 9), or unknown sensitivity (n = 10). Hematologic and cytogenetic response rates were similar for patients with or without mutations. For patients in chronic phase, hematologic and cytogenetic responses correlated with mutation score; tumors with low and intermediate scores had lower response rates than those with highly sensitive mutations, and worse event-free and overall survival. These correlations with overall survival were not seen for advanced phases. Mutation scoring can predict outcome in CML-chronic phase with imatinib failure treated with second-generation TKIs and can help in therapy selection. More complex prognostic models will be required for advanced stages of disease.","19567878","VD","19567878","1"
"Epigenetic regulation of the alternatively activated macrophage phenotype.","2009","Alternatively activated (M2) macrophages play critical roles in diverse chronic diseases, including parasite infections, cancer, and allergic responses. However, little is known about the acquisition and maintenance of their phenotype. We report that M2-macrophage marker genes are epigenetically regulated by reciprocal changes in histone H3 lysine-4 (H3K4) and histone H3 lysine-27 (H3K27) methylation; and the latter methylation marks are removed by the H3K27 demethylase Jumonji domain containing 3 (Jmjd3). We found that continuous interleukin-4 (IL-4) treatment leads to decreased H3K27 methylation, at the promoter of M2 marker genes, and a concomitant increase in Jmjd3 expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IL-4-dependent Jmjd3 expression is mediated by STAT6, a major transcription factor of IL-4-mediated signaling. After IL-4 stimulation, activated STAT6 is increased and binds to consensus sites at the Jmjd3 promoter. Increased Jmjd3 contributes to the decrease of H3K27 dimethylation and trimethylation (H3K27me2/3) marks as well as the transcriptional activation of specific M2 marker genes. The decrease in H3K27me2/3 and increase in Jmjd3 recruitment were confirmed by in vivo studies using a Schistosoma mansoni egg-challenged mouse model, a well-studied system known to support an M2 phenotype. Collectively, these data indicate that chromatin remodeling is mechanistically important in the acquisition of the M2-macrophage phenotype.","19567879","VD","19567878","2"
"Philadelphia-positive patients who already harbor imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutations have a higher likelihood of developing additional mutations associated with resistance to second- or third-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","2009","Dasatinib and nilotinib are tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) developed to overcome imatinib resistance in Philadelphia-positive leukemias. To assess how Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutation status evolves during sequential therapy with these TKIs and which mutations may further develop and impair their efficacy, we monitored the mutation status of 95 imatinib-resistant patients before and during treatment with dasatinib and/or nilotinib as second or third TKI. We found that 83% of cases of relapse after an initial response are associated with emergence of newly acquired mutations. However, the spectra of mutants conferring resistance to dasatinib or nilotinib are small and nonoverlapping, except for T315I. Patients already harboring mutations had higher likelihood of relapse associated with development of further mutations compared with patients who did not harbor mutations (23 of 51 vs 8 of 44, respectively, for patients who relapsed on second TKI; 13 of 20 vs 1 of 6, respectively, for patients who relapsed on third TKI).","19589924","IVD","19589924","1"
"Selective reduction of JAK2V617F-dependent cell growth by siRNA/shRNA and its reversal by cytokines.","2009","The JAK(V617F) mutation is responsible for the majority of breakpoint cluster region (BCR)/Abelson (ABL)-negative myeloproliferative disorders. Ongoing clinical trials of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitors in myeloproliferative disorder patients use small molecules targeting both wild-type and mutated JAK2. To selectively target malignant cells, we developed JAK2(V617F)-specific small interfering RNAs or short hairpin RNAs. Expression of these RNAs in cell lines or CD34(+) cells from patients reduced JAK2(V617F)-driven autonomous cell proliferation. Mechanisms of inhibition involved selective JAK2(V617F) protein down-regulation, and consequently, decrease in signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 phosphorylation, cell-cycle progression, and cell survival. However, the addition of high concentrations of cytokines to cell lines or erythropoietin to patient cells greatly reduced growth inhibition. Similarly, the efficacy of a JAK2 small molecule inhibitor on cell line and patient cell proliferation dose dependently decreased with the addition of cytokines. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to specifically target JAK2(V617F) by RNA interference (RNAi) strategies. In addition, cytokines partially reverse the inhibition induced by both RNAi and small molecule approaches. This strongly suggests that patient cytokine levels in current JAK2 inhibitor clinical trials modulate the outcome of these therapies.","19589925","IVD","19589924","2"
"Distinct gene mutation profiles among luminal-type and basal-type breast cancer cell lines.","2010","Breast cancer has for long been recognized as a highly diverse tumor group, but the underlying genetic basis has been elusive. Here, we report an extensive molecular characterization of a collection of 41 human breast cancer cell lines. Protein and gene expression analyses indicated that the collection of breast cancer cell lines has retained most, if not all, molecular characteristics that are typical for clinical breast cancers. Gene mutation analyses identified 146 oncogenic mutations among 27 well-known cancer genes, amounting to an average of 3.6 mutations per cell line. Mutations in genes from the p53, RB and PI3K tumor suppressor pathways were widespread among all breast cancer cell lines. Most important, we have identified two gene mutation profiles that are specifically associated with luminal-type and basal-type breast cancer cell lines. The luminal mutation profile involved E-cadherin and MAP2K4 gene mutations and amplifications of Cyclin D1, ERBB2 and HDM2, whereas the basal mutation profile involved BRCA1, RB1, RAS and BRAF gene mutations and deletions of p16 and p14ARF. These subtype-specific gene mutation profiles constitute a genetic basis for the heterogeneity observed among human breast cancers, providing clues for their underlying biology and providing guidance for targeted pharmacogenetic intervention in breast cancer patients.","19593635","VD","19593635","1"
"Antimitotic chemotherapeutics promote adhesive responses in detached and circulating tumor cells.","2010","In the clinical treatment of breast cancer, antimitotic cytotoxic agents are one of the most commonly employed chemotherapies, owing largely to their antiproliferative effects on the growth and survival of adherent cells in studies that model primary tumor growth. Importantly, the manner in which these chemotherapeutics impact the metastatic process remains unclear. Furthermore, since dissemination of tumor cells through the systemic circulation and lymphatics necessitates periods of detached survival, it is equally important to consider how circulating tumor cells respond to such compounds. To address this question, we exposed both nontumorigenic and tumor-derived epithelial cell lines to two antitumor compounds, jasplakinolide and paclitaxel (Taxol), in a series of attached and detached states. We report here that jasplakinolide promoted the extension of microtubule-based projections and microtentacle protrusions in adherent and suspended cells, respectively. These protrusions were specifically enriched by upregulation of a stable post-translationally modified form of alpha-tubulin, and this occurred prior to, and independently of any reductions in cellular viability. Microtubule stabilization with Taxol significantly enhanced these effects. Additionally, Taxol promoted the attachment and spreading of suspended tumor cell populations on extracellular matrix. While the antiproliferative effects of these compounds are well recognized and clinically valuable, our findings that microfilament and microtubule binding chemotherapeutics rapidly increase the mechanisms that promote endothelial adhesion of circulating tumor cells warrant caution to avoid inadvertently enhancing metastatic potential, while targeting cell division.","19593636","VD","19593635","2"
"MET Y1253D-activating point mutation and development of distant metastasis in advanced head and neck cancers.","2009","We investigated if the MET-activating point mutation Y1253D influences clinical outcomes in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). The study population consisted of 152 HNSCC patients treated by hyperfractionated radiotherapy alone or concomitant with chemotherapy between September 1994 and July 2000. Tumors were screened for the presence of the MET-activating point mutation Y1253D. Seventy-eight patients (51%) received radiotherapy alone, 74 patients (49%) underwent radiotherapy concomitant with chemotherapy. Median patient age was 54 years and median follow-up was 5.5 years. Distant metastasis-free survival, local relapse-free survival and overall survival were compared with MET Y1253D status. During follow-up, 29 (19%) patients developed distant metastasis. MET Y1253D was detected in tumors of 21 out of 152 patients (14%). Distant metastasis-free survival (P = 0.008) was associated with MET Y1253D. In a multivariate Cox regression model, adjusted for T-category, only presence of MET Y1253D was associated with decreased distant metastasis-free survival: hazard ratio = 2.5 (95% confidence interval: 1.1, 5.8). The observed association between MET Y1253D-activating point mutation and decreased distant metastasis-free survival in advanced HNSCC suggests that MET may be a potential target for specific treatment interventions.","19639388","IVD","19639388","1"
"A cognitively normal PDH-deficient 18-year-old man carrying the R263G mutation in the PDHA1 gene.","2009","Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a crucial multienzyme system linking glycolysis to the tricarboxylic acid cycle by catalysing the decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Deficiency in pyruvate dehydrogenase is most commonly secondary to mutations in the X-linked PDHA1 gene encoding the E1 alpha subunit. There is a wide range of clinical presentations from severe neonatal lactic acidosis to chronic encephalopathy (Leigh syndrome). In recent years, a small subset of patients was recognized with less severe involvement, presenting initially only with intermittent symptoms, mainly of ataxia. Most of these patients remain stable for a number of years before developing progressive neurological deterioration around puberty at the latest. There does not appear to be a reliable correlation between genotype, phenotype, or enzyme activity. This makes counselling in a clinical setting challenging. We report a case with a previously known common mutation in PDHA1 (R263G) with an excellent outcome at 18 years of age. Previous patients with this mutation have presented with mental retardation and/or Leigh syndrome, while our patient's clinical outcome is exceptional. He is cognitively normal and has normal brain MRI. His management includes a stringent carbohydrate-free diet, as well as supplementation with thiamine, carnitine and vitamin E.

"Impact of baseline BCR-ABL mutations on response to nilotinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase.","2009","PURPOSE. Nilotinib is a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP; CML-CP) and accelerated phase (AP; CML-AP) who are resistant to or intolerant of prior imatinib therapy. In this subanalysis of a phase II study of nilotinib in patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CML-CP, the occurrence and impact of baseline and newly detectable BCR-ABL mutations were assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Baseline mutation data were assessed in 281 (88%) of 321 patients with CML-CP in the phase II nilotinib registration trial. RESULTS. Among imatinib-resistant patients, the frequency of mutations at baseline was 55%. After 12 months of therapy, major cytogenetic response (MCyR) was achieved in 60%, complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) in 40%, and major molecular response (MMR) in 29% of patients without baseline mutations versus 49% (P = .145), 32% (P = .285), and 22% (P = .366), respectively, of patients with mutations. Responses in patients who harbored mutations with high in vitro sensitivity to nilotinib (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] <or= 150 nM) or mutations with unknown nilotinib sensitivity were equivalent to those responses for patients without mutations (not significant). Patients with mutations that were less sensitive to nilotinib in vitro (IC(50) > 150 nM; Y253H, E255V/K, F359V/C) had less favorable responses, as 13%, 43%, and 9% of patients with each of these mutations, respectively, achieved MCyR; none achieved CCyR. CONCLUSION. For most patients with imatinib resistance and with mutations, nilotinib offers a substantial probability of response. However, mutational status at baseline may influence response. Less sensitive mutations that occurred at three residues defined in this study, as well as the T315I mutation, may be associated with less favorable responses to nilotinib.","19652056","IIB","19652056","1"

X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is an inhibitor of caspases 3 and 9 which are overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and may contribute to chemoresistance. We report on a phase I/II trial of the XIAP antisense oligonucleotide AEG35156 in combination with reinduction chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Twenty-four patients with rapidly relapsed or refractory AML were treated with escalating doses of AEG35156 (12 to 250 mg/m(2)) as an intravenous solution over 2 hours and 32 patients were treated with the highest planned dose of 350 mg/m(2) in combination with idarubicin and high-dose cytarabine reinduction chemotherapy. Correlative studies were conducted to determine the effects of AEG35156 on levels of XIAP mRNA. RESULTS. Knockdown of XIAP mRNA during treatment increased with the dose of the antisense. All patients who received 350 mg/m(2) of AEG35156 had higher than 30% target knockdown with a median maximal knockdown of 90% (range, 48% to 100%). The overall response rate was higher among the patients receiving the highest dose of AEG35156. In this group, 15 (47%) of 32 patients achieved complete response (CR)/CR with incomplete platelet count recovery (CRp) compared with only one (4%) of 24 receiving 12 to 250 mg/m(2) AEG35156. Among the patients receiving 350 mg/m(2) of AEG35156 in combination with chemotherapy, 10 (91%) of 11 who were refractory to a single induction chemotherapy regimen achieved CR/CRp after reinduction with AEG35156 and chemotherapy. AEG35156 was well tolerated save for two cases of peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving multiple doses of AEG35156. CONCLUSION. At the highest dose tested, AEG35156 knocks down its target and appears very effective when combined with chemotherapy in patients with AML refractory to a single induction regimen.","19652057","IIB","19652056","2"

X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is an inhibitor of caspases 3 and 9 which are overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and may contribute to chemoresistance. We report on a phase I/II trial of the XIAP antisense oligonucleotide AEG35156 in combination with reinduction chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Twenty-four patients with rapidly relapsed or refractory AML were treated with escalating doses of AEG35156 (12 to 250 mg/m(2)) as an intravenous solution over 2 hours and 32 patients were treated with the highest planned dose of 350 mg/m(2) in combination with idarubicin and high-dose cytarabine reinduction chemotherapy. Correlative studies were conducted to determine the effects of AEG35156 on levels of XIAP mRNA. RESULTS. Knockdown of XIAP mRNA during treatment increased with the dose of the antisense. All patients who received 350 mg/m(2) of AEG35156 had higher than 30% target knockdown with a median maximal knockdown of 90% (range, 48% to 100%). The overall response rate was higher among the patients receiving the highest dose of AEG35156. In this group, 15 (47%) of 32 patients achieved complete response (CR)/CR with incomplete platelet count recovery (CRp) compared with only one (4%) of 24 receiving 12 to 250 mg/m(2) AEG35156. Among the patients receiving 350 mg/m(2) of AEG35156 in combination with chemotherapy, 10 (91%) of 11 who were refractory to a single induction chemotherapy regimen achieved CR/CRp after reinduction with AEG35156 and chemotherapy. AEG35156 was well tolerated save for two cases of peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving multiple doses of AEG35156. CONCLUSION. At the highest dose tested, AEG35156 knocks down its target and appears very effective when combined with chemotherapy in patients with AML refractory to a single induction regimen.","19652057","VD","19652056","2"
"Double EGFR mutants containing rare EGFR mutant types show reduced in vitro response to gefitinib compared with common activating missense mutations.","2009","Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are common in lung adenocarcinomas, especially from nonsmoking women of Asian descent. We have previously shown EGFR mutations occur in >70% of lung adenocarcinoma from nonsmokers in our population with a complex mutational profile, including 13% of EGFR double mutations. In this study, we investigated the in vitro gefitinib response of four EGFR double mutants identified in untreated patients, including Q787R+L858R, E709A+G719C, T790M+L858R, and H870R+L858R. The phosphorylation profiles of EGFR and downstream effectors AKT, STAT3/5, and ERK1/2 were compared by immunoblot analyses among the single and double mutants transfected into H358 cells. Results showed that mutants responded to in vitro gefitinib treatment with different sensitivities. The G719C and L858R single mutants showed the highest gefitinib sensitivity compared with the corresponding coexisting single mutants E709A, Q787R, H870R, and T790M. The double mutants E709A+G719C, Q787R+L858R, and H870R+L858R showed attenuated responses to gefitinib in the EGFR and downstream effector phosphorylation profiles compared with G719C or L858R alone. T790M+L858R showed strong resistance to gefitinib. Clinically, the patient whose tumor contained H870R+L858R showed tumor stabilization by 250 mg oral gefitinib daily but cerebral metastasis developed 6 months later. Correlation with the in vitro phosphorylation profile of H870R+L858R suggested that treatment failure was probably due to inadequate suppression of EGFR signaling by the drug level attainable in the cerebrospinal fluid at the given oral dosage. Overall, the findings suggested that rare types of EGFR substitution mutations could confer relative gefitinib resistance when combined with the common activating mutants.","19671738","VD","19671738","1"
"Gene expression signatures and response to imatinib mesylate in gastrointestinal stromal tumor.","2009","Despite initial efficacy of imatinib mesylate in most gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients, many experience primary/secondary drug resistance. Therefore, clinical management of GIST may benefit from further molecular characterization of tumors before and after imatinib mesylate treatment. As part of a recent phase II trial of neoadjuvant/adjuvant imatinib mesylate treatment for advanced primary and recurrent operable GISTs (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group S0132), gene expression profiling using oligonucleotide microarrays was done on tumor samples obtained before and after imatinib mesylate therapy. Patients were classified according to changes in tumor size after treatment based on computed tomography scan measurements. Gene profiling data were evaluated with Statistical Analysis of Microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes (in pretreatment GIST samples). Based on Statistical Analysis of Microarrays [False Discovery Rate (FDR), 10%], 38 genes were expressed at significantly lower levels in the pretreatment biopsy samples from tumors that significantly responded to 8 to 12 weeks of imatinib mesylate, that is, >25% tumor reduction. Eighteen of these genes encoded Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain containing zinc finger (ZNF) transcriptional repressors. Importantly, 10 KRAB-ZNF genes mapped to a single locus on chromosome 19p, and a subset predicted likely response to imatinib mesylate-based therapy in a naïve panel of GIST. Furthermore, we found that modifying expression of genes within this predictive signature can enhance the sensitivity of GIST cells to imatinib mesylate. Using clinical pretreatment biopsy samples from a prospective neoadjuvant phase II trial, we have identified a gene signature that includes KRAB-ZNF 91 subfamily members that may be both predictive of and functionally associated with likely response to short-term imatinib mesylate treatment.","19671739","VD","19671738","2"
"Impact of epidermal growth factor receptor and KRAS mutations on clinical outcomes in previously untreated non-small cell lung cancer patients: results of an online tumor registry of clinical trials.","2009","PURPOSE. The impact of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and KRAS genotypes on outcomes with erlotinib or gefitinib therapy continues to be debated. This study combines patient data from five trials in predominantly Western populations to assess the impact of EGFR and KRAS mutations on first-line therapy with an EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and compare clinical versus molecular predictors of sensitivity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. Chemotherapy-naïve patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and known EGFR mutation status treated with erlotinib or gefitinib monotherapy as part of a clinical trial were eligible for inclusion. Patients received daily erlotinib (150 mg) or gefitinib (250 mg) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Data were collected in a password-protected web database. Clinical outcomes were analyzed to look for differences based on EGFR and KRAS genotypes, as well as clinical characteristics. RESULTS. Patients (223) from five clinical trials were included. Sensitizing EGFR mutations were associated with a 67% response rate, time to progression (TTP) of 11.8 months, and overall survival of 23.9 months. Exon 19 deletions were associated with longer median TTP and overall survival compared with L858R mutations. Wild-type EGFR was associated with poorer outcomes (response rate, 3%; TTP, 3.2 months) irrespective of KRAS status. No difference in outcome was seen between patients harboring KRAS transition versus transversion mutations. EGFR genotype was more effective than clinical characteristics at selecting appropriate patients for consideration of first-line therapy with an EGFR-TKI. CONCLUSION. EGFR mutation status is associated with sensitivity to treatment with an EGFR-TKI in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Patients harboring sensitizing EGFR mutations should be considered for first-line erlotinib or gefitinib.","19671843","IA","19671843","1"
"Heat shock protein 90 inhibitor BIIB021 (CNF2024) depletes NF-kappaB and sensitizes Hodgkin's lymphoma cells for natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity.","2009","PURPOSE. In Hodgkin's lymphoma, constitutive activation of NF-kappaB promotes tumor cell survival and proliferation. The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) has immune regulatory activity and supports the activation of NF-kappaB in Hodgkin's lymphoma cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. We analyzed the effect of HSP90 inhibition on viability and NF-kappaB activity in Hodgkin's lymphoma cells and the consequences for their recognition and killing through natural killer (NK) cells. RESULTS. The novel orally administrable HSP90 inhibitor BIIB021 (CNF2024) inhibited Hodgkin's lymphoma cell viability at low nanomolar concentrations in synergy with doxorubicin and gemcitabine. Annexin V/7-aminoactinomycin D binding assay revealed that BIIB021 selectively induced cell death in Hodgkin's lymphoma cells but not in lymphocytes from healthy individuals. We observed that BIIB021 inhibited the constitutive activity of NF-kappaB and this was independent of IkappaB mutations. Furthermore, we analyzed the effect of HSP90 inhibition on NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. BIIB021 induced the expression of ligands for the activating NK cell receptor NKG2D on Hodgkin's lymphoma cells resulting in an increased susceptibility to NK cell-mediated killing. In a xenograft model of Hodgkin's lymphoma, HSP90 inhibition significantly delayed tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS. HSP90 inhibition has direct antitumor activity in Hodgkin's lymphoma in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, HSP90 inhibition may sensitize Hodgkin's lymphoma cells for NK cell-mediated killing via up-regulation of ligands engaging activating NK cell receptors.","19671844","IA","19671843","2"
"Activate and resist: L576P-KIT in GIST.","2009","L576P is a rare KIT mutation often reported in cancers other than gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). In GISTs, it correlates with features linked to an aggressive phenotype, eventually resulting in secondary mutations. In vitro findings point out that L576P/KIT is constitutively activated, and shows poor imatinib sensitivity. In this work, histological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analyses, coupled with mutational-molecular analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization, were applied to surgical specimens. In parallel, the affinities of wild-type, L576P/KIT, and Delta559/KIT for imatinib were estimated by in silico studies. Despite imatinib treatment and the apparent clinical-imaging response, the detected histological response was very low. KIT resulted, expressed and activated in absence of secondary mutations, BRAF/NRAS mutations, and KIT/PDGFRA gene alterations. Computer modeling proved that L576P/KIT is two times less sensitive than the wild-type counterpart and considerably less affine to imatinib than the sensitive Delta559/KIT. Accordingly, the modeling evidence strongly supports the lack of tumoral regression we observed at the histological level.","19723893","VD","19723893","1"
"Triptolide induces cell death independent of cellular responses to imatinib in blast crisis chronic myelogenous leukemia cells including quiescent CD34+ primitive progenitor cells.","2009","The advent of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has revolutionized the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, resistance evolves due to BCR-ABL mutations and other mechanisms. Furthermore, patients with blast crisis CML are less responsive and quiescent CML stem cells are insensitive to these inhibitors. We found that triptolide, a diterpenoid, at nanomolar concentrations, promoted equally significant death of KBM5 cells, a cell line derived from a Bcr-Abl-bearing blast crisis CML patient and KBM5STI571 cells, an imatinib-resistant KBM5 subline bearing the T315I mutation. Similarly, Ba/F3 cells harboring mutated BCR-ABL were as sensitive as Ba/F3Bcr-Abl(p210wt) cells to triptolide. Importantly, triptolide induced apoptosis in primary samples from blast crisis CML patients, who showed resistance to Bcr-Abl TKIs in vivo, with less toxicity to normal cells. Triptolide decreased X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, Mcl-1, and Bcr-Abl protein levels in K562, KBM5, and KBM5STI571 cells and in cells from blast crisis CML patients. It sensitized KBM5, but not KBM5STI571, cells to imatinib. More importantly, triptolide also induced death of quiescent CD34(+) CML progenitor cells, a major problem in the therapy of CML with TKIs. Collectively, these results suggest that triptolide potently induces blast crisis CML cell death independent of the cellular responses to Bcr-Abl TKIs, suggesting that triptolide could eradicate residual quiescent CML progenitor cells in TKI-treated patients and benefit TKI-resistant blast crisis CML patients.","19723894","VD","19723893","2"
"Dasatinib treatment of chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia: analysis of responses according to preexisting BCR-ABL mutations.","2009","Dasatinib is a BCR-ABL inhibitor with 325-fold higher potency than imatinib against unmutated BCR-ABL in vitro.

Among 1043 patients, 39% had a preexisting BCR-ABL mutation, including 48% of 805 patients with imatinib resistance or suboptimal response. Sixty-threedifferent BCR-ABL mutations affecting 49 amino acids were detected at baseline, with G250, M351, M244, and F359 most frequently affected.

High response rates were achieved with different mutations except T315I, including highly imatinib-resistant mutations in the P-loop region. Impaired responses were observed with some mutations with a dasatinib median inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) greater than 3nM; among patients with mutations with lower or unknown IC(50), efficacy was comparable with those with no mutation.

"Selectin-mediated activation of endothelial cells induces expression of CCL5 and promotes metastasis through recruitment of monocytes.","2009","Hematogenous metastasis is promoted by interactions of tumor cells with leukocytes, platelets, and the endothelium in the local intravascular microenvironment. Here we show that the activation of the microvascular endothelium results in recruitment of monocytes to metastatic tumor cells and promotes the establishment of the metastatic microenvironment. This inflammatory-like endothelial response was observed in microvascular endothelial cells only. Microarray analysis of microvascular endothelial cells cocultured with tumor cells in the presence of leukocytes and platelets revealed a specific gene expression profile. Selectin-mediated interactions of tumor cells with platelets and leukocytes activated endothelial cells and induced production of C-C chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5). Inhibition of CCL5-dependent monocyte recruitment during the early phase of metastasis by a CCL5 receptor antagonist strongly reduced tumor cell survival and attenuated metastasis.

"RAS mutations are the predominant molecular alteration in poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas and bear prognostic impact.","2009","CONTEXT. Poorly differentiated carcinomas represent an aggressive group of thyroid tumors with controversial classification placement and poorly understood pathogenesis. Molecular data in this group of tumors are extremely heterogeneous, possibly reflecting different inclusion criteria. Recently homogeneous diagnostic criteria have been proposed by our group (Turin proposal) that need to be complemented by detailed molecular characterization. OBJECTIVE. The objective of the study was to define a comprehensive molecular typing of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas classified following homogeneous diagnostic criteria. DESIGN. Sixty-five cases of poorly differentiated carcinoma selected following the Turin proposal have been screened for N-, K-, H-RAS, BRAF, RET/PTC1 and 3, and PAX8/PPARgamma mutations-rearrangements using alternative techniques and in two different laboratories. Molecular data were compared with clinical pathological parameters and survival by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS. RAS mutations in codon 61 were by far the most common genetic alteration in poorly differentiated carcinomas (23% of cases), with all mutation in NRAS except one in the HRAS gene. A single BRAF mutation was found in a poorly differentiated carcinoma with a residual component of a tall cell variant of papillary carcinoma. No KRAS, RET/PTC, or PAX8/PPARgamma genetic alteration was detected. In this series, the presence of RAS mutations was a unique negative prognostic parameter at multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS. The present study demonstrates that strictly classified poorly differentiated carcinomas are genetically homogeneous, RAS mutations being the almost exclusive genetic event. Moreover, the detection of RAS mutations might be clinically relevant for the prognostic stratification of these tumors.","19837916","VD","19837916","1"
"Wolcott-Rallison syndrome is the most common genetic cause of permanent neonatal diabetes in consanguineous families.","2009","CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE. Mutations in EIF2AK3 cause Wolcott-Rallison syndrome (WRS), a rare recessive disorder characterized by early-onset diabetes, skeletal abnormalities, and liver dysfunction. Although early diagnosis is important for clinical management, genetic testing is generally performed after the full clinical picture develops. We aimed to identify patients with WRS before any other abnormalities apart from diabetes are present and study the overall frequency of WRS among patients with permanent neonatal diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS. The coding regions of EIF2AK3 were sequenced in 34 probands with infancy-onset diabetes with a clinical phenotype suggestive of WRS (n = 28) or homozygosity at the WRS locus (n = 6). RESULTS. Twenty-five probands (73.5%) were homozygous or compound heterozygous for mutations in EIF2AK3. Twenty of the 26 mutations identified were novel. Whereas a diagnosis of WRS was suspected before genetic testing in 22 probands, three patients with apparently isolated diabetes were diagnosed after identifying a large homozygous region encompassing EIF2AK3. In contrast to nonconsanguineous pedigrees, mutations in EIF2AK3 are the most common known genetic cause of diabetes among patients born to consanguineous parents (24 vs. < 2%). Age at diabetes onset and birth weight might be used to prioritize genetic testing in the latter group. CONCLUSIONS. WRS is the most common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus in consanguineous pedigrees. In addition to testing patients with a definite clinical diagnosis, EIF2AK3 should be tested in patients with isolated neonatal diabetes diagnosed after 3 wk of age from known consanguineous families, isolated populations, or countries in which inbreeding is frequent.","19837917","VD","19837916","2"
"Rare mutations in the PIK3CA gene contribute to aggressive endometrial cancer.","2010","The molecular basis of endometrial cancer (EC), a common gynecologic malignancy, often includes mutational activation of the PIK3CA and KRAS genes. We aimed to determine the distribution of mutations in the two genes depending on patient clinocopathological characteristics. We sequenced exon 1 of the KRAS gene and exons 9 and 20 of the PIK3CA gene in 108 consecutive EC tumor samples. PIK3CA mutations were present in 24 of the 108 (22.2%) cases and KRAS mutations in 18 of the 108 (16.7%) cases. PIK3CA mutations occurred more frequently in KRAS-mutated samples (7/18, 38.9%; p = 0.06) than in KRAS wild type (17/90, 18.9%) and showed a very high frequency in metastatic tumors (4/9, 44.4%; p = 0.1) and in samples displaying serous differentiation-serous and mixed endometrioid/serous tumors (6/12, 50.0%; p = 0.021)-where KRAS mutations were rare (11.1% and 16.7%, respectively) and did not exist independently of a PIK3CA mutation. Non-hotspot (i.e., non-E542K, -E545K, and -H1047R) mutations in the PIK3CA gene showed higher frequency in metastatic cases (3/9, 33.3%; p = 0.05). Tumors displaying serous differentiation showed a particular pattern-they harbored exclusively mutations in PIK3CA exon 20 (5/12, 41.7%; p = 0.005) and most of these were non-hotspot (4/12, 33.3%; p = 0.02). In all other comparisons exons 9 and 20 mutation distribution did not differ. These results suggest the need for further exploration of the significance of PIK3CA mutations in respect to aggressive EC.","19839777","IVD","19839777","1"
"Association between bone morphogenetic protein 4 gene polymorphisms with nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate in a chilean population.","2010","Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCLP) is one of the most common birth defects in humans with both genetic and environmental components involved in its expression. Experimental evidences have postulated that bone morphogenetic protein 4 gene (Bmp4) is involved in the etiology of cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) in mice. In our study we analyzed the association between BMP4 and NSCLP in a sample of 150 unrelated trios ascertained through affected probands. Three BMP4 polymorphisms were analyzed, two intronic (rs762642 and rs2855532) and rs1957860, located 5.7 kb upstream from BMP4. Transmission/disequilibrium tests were performed at the allele and haplotype levels. Our results did not detect preferential transmission for individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Significant transmission distortion was observed for haplotypes rs1957860-rs762642 (p = 0.018), especially for C-T (p = 0.015) and T-T (p = 0.018) which include the genomic region where the promoter and an enhancer of BMP4 are located. Thus, despite the positive association detected between these haplotypes and NSCLP they probably do not have a functional effect on BMP4 expression or protein activity but possibly reflect NSCLP susceptibility changes which are in linkage disequilibrium with these polymorphisms. The findings of our study support a role for BMP4 in NSCLP in the admixed Chilean population.","19839778","IVD","19839777","2"
"Comprehensive genomic analysis reveals clinically relevant molecular distinctions between thymic carcinomas and thymomas.","2009","PURPOSE. Thymomas and thymic carcinomas are rare intrathoracic malignancies that can be invasive and refractory to conventional treatment. Because these tumors both originate from the thymus, they are often grouped together clinically. However, whether the underlying biology of these tumors warrants such clustering is unclear, and the optimum treatment of either entity is unknown. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. All thymic tumors were profiled for mutations in genes encoding components of the EGFR and KIT signaling pathways, assessed for EGFR and KIT expression by immunohistochemistry, and analyzed by array-based comparative genomic hybridization. Previously untreated tumors were subjected to global gene expression arrays. RESULTS. We analyzed 45 thymic tumors [thymoma, n = 38 (type A, n = 8; type B2, n = 22; type B3, n = 8); thymic carcinoma, n = 7]. One thymoma and one thymic carcinoma harbored KRAS mutations (G12A and G12V, respectively), and one thymoma had a G13V HRAS mutation. Three tumors displayed strong KIT staining. Two thymic carcinomas harbored somatic KIT mutations (V560del and H697Y). In cell viability assays, the V560del mutant was associated with similar sensitivities to imatinib and sunitinib, whereas the H697Y mutant displayed greater sensitivity to sunitinib. Genomic profiling revealed distinct differences between type A to B2 thymomas versus type B3 and thymic carcinomas. Moreover, array-based comparative genomic hybridization could readily distinguish squamous cell carcinomas of the thymus versus the lung, which can often present a diagnostic challenge. CONCLUSIONS. Comprehensive genomic analysis suggests that thymic carcinomas are molecularly distinct from thymomas. These data have clinical, pathologic, and therapeutic implications for the treatment of thymic malignancies.","19861435","IVD","19861435","1"
"Reciprocal regulation of c-Src and STAT3 in non-small cell lung cancer.","2009","PURPOSE. Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) is downstream of growth factor and cytokine receptors, and regulates key oncogenic pathways in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Activation of STAT3 by cellular Src (c-Src) promotes tumor progression. We hypothesized that c-Src inhibition could activate STAT3 by inducing a homeostatic feedback loop, contributing to c-Src inhibitor resistance. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. The effects of c-Src inhibition on total and phosphorylated STAT3 were measured in NSCLC cell lines and in murine xenograft models by Western blotting. c-Src and STAT3 activity as indicated by phosphorylation was determined in 46 human tumors and paired normal lung by reverse phase protein array. Modulation of dasatinib (c-Src inhibitor) cytotoxicity by STAT3 knockdown was measured by MTT, cell cycle, and apoptosis assays. RESULTS. Depletion of c-Src by small interfering RNA or sustained inhibition by dasatinib increased pSTAT3, which could be blocked by inhibition of JAK. Similarly, in vivo pSTAT3 levels initially decreased but were strongly induced after sustained dasatinib treatment. In human tumors, phosphorylation of the autoinhibitory site of c-Src (Y527) correlated with STAT3 phosphorylation (r = 0.64; P = 2.5 x 10(-6)). STAT3 knockdown enhanced the cytotoxicity of dasatinib. CONCLUSIONS. c-Src inhibition leads to JAK-dependent STAT3 activation in vitro and in vivo. STAT3 knockdown enhances the cytotoxicity of dasatinib, suggesting a compensatory pathway that allows NSCLC survival. Data from human tumors showed a reciprocal regulation of c-Src and STAT3 activation, suggesting that this compensatory pathway functions in human NSCLC. These results provide a rationale for combining c-Src and STAT3 inhibition to improve clinical responses.","19861436","IVD","19861435","2"
"KRAS and BRAF mutations in advanced colorectal cancer are associated with poor prognosis but do not preclude benefit from oxaliplatin or irinotecan: results from the MRC FOCUS trial.","2009","PURPOSE. Activating mutation of the KRAS oncogene is an established predictive biomarker for resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) therapies in advanced colorectal cancer (aCRC). We wanted to determine whether KRAS and/or BRAF mutation is also a predictive biomarker for other aCRC therapies. PATIENTS AND METHODS. The Medical Research Council Fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin and Irinotecan: Use and Sequencing (MRC FOCUS) trial compared treatment sequences including first-line fluorouracil (FU), FU/irinotecan or FU/oxaliplatin in aCRC. Tumor blocks were obtained from 711 consenting patients. DNA was extracted and KRAS codons 12, 13, and 61 and BRAF codon 600 were assessed by pyrosequencing. Mutation (mut) status was assessed first as a prognostic factor and then as a predictive biomarker for the benefit of adding irinotecan or oxaliplatin to FU. The association of BRAF-mut with loss of MLH1 was assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS. Three hundred eight (43.3%) of 711 patients had KRAS-mut and 56 (7.9%) of 711 had BRAF-mut. Mutation of KRAS, BRAF, or both was present in 360 (50.6%) of 711 patients. Mutation in either KRAS or BRAF was a poor prognostic factor for overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR], 1.40; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.65; P < .0001) but had minimal impact on progression-free survival (PFS; HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.36; P = .05). Mutation status did not affect the impact of irinotecan or oxaliplatin on PFS or OS. BRAF-mut was weakly associated with loss of MLH1 staining (P = .012). CONCLUSION. KRAS/BRAF mutation is associated with poor prognosis but is not a predictive biomarker for irinotecan or oxaliplatin. There is no evidence that patients with KRAS/BRAF mutated tumors are less likely to benefit from these standard chemotherapy agents.","19884549","IIB","19884549","1"

Patients (N = 301) with hemoglobin (Hb) less than 15 g/dL were randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1 to receive radiotherapy plus epoetin alfa (10,000 U subcutaneously [SC] three times weekly if baseline Hb was < 12.5 g/dL; 4,000 U SC three times weekly if baseline Hb > or = 12.5 g/dL) or radiotherapy alone. Hb levels were monitored weekly. The primary end point was local DFS, defined as the time from random assignment to local disease recurrence or death. Secondary efficacy end points included OS, local tumor response, and local tumor control. Patients were followed at 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks postradiotherapy and annually for 5 years. Cancer treatment-related anemia and fatigue were evaluated with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and Neck. Adverse events were recorded up to 12 weeks postradiotherapy. RESULTS. Hb levels increased from baseline with epoetin alfa. The median duration of local DFS was not statistically different between groups (observation, 35.42 months; epoetin alfa, 31.47 months; hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.41). Groups did not significantly differ in DFS, OS, tumor outcomes, or cancer treatment-related anemia or fatigue. No new or unexpected adverse events were observed. CONCLUSION. Addition of epoetin alfa to radical radiotherapy did not affect survival, tumor outcomes, anemia, or fatigue positively or negatively in patients with head and neck cancer.","19884550","IIB","19884549","2"
"PIK3CA mutations predict local recurrences in rectal cancer patients.","2009","PURPOSE. Identifying rectal cancer patients at risk for local recurrence would allow for refinement in the selection of patients who would benefit from preoperative radiotherapy. PIK3CA, KRAS, and BRAF mutations are commonly found in colon cancers, but their prevalence has not been clearly assessed in rectal cancer. In this study, we aim to determine the mutation frequencies of PIK3CA, KRAS, and BRAF and to investigate whether a mutation may be used as a prognostic parameter in rectal cancer patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. We evaluated DNA mutations in PIK3CA, KRAS, and BRAF in 240 stage I to III rectal tumors obtained from nonirradiated patients from the Dutch Total Mesorectal Excision trial. RESULTS. PIK3CA, KRAS, and BRAF mutations were identified in 19 (7.9%), 81 (33.9%), and 5 (2.1%) rectal cancers. Patients with PIK3CA mutations developed more local recurrences (5-year risks, 27.8% versus 9.4%; P = 0.006) and tended to develop these recurrences more rapidly after surgery (median local recurrence-free interval since surgery: 7.9 versus 19.6 months; P = 0.07) than patients without PIK3CA mutations. In multivariate analysis, PIK3CA mutations remained as an independent predictor for the development of local recurrences (hazard ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-9.2; P = 0.017), next to tumor-node-metastasis stage. CONCLUSION. PIK3CA mutations can be used as a biomarker in identifying rectal cancer patients with an increased risk for local recurrences. Currently, our findings suggest that prospective evaluation of PIK3CA mutation status could reduce overtreatment by preoperative radiotherapy for the low-risk patients who might otherwise only experience the side effects.","19903786","IVD","19903786","1"
"Electrocardiographic characterization of the QTc interval in patients with advanced solid tumors: pharmacokinetic- pharmacodynamic evaluation of sunitinib.","2009","PURPOSE. To evaluate the effects of sunitinib, a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, on the QT interval in patients with cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. Patients received sunitinib loading doses (150-200 mg) on days 3 and 9 and maintenance doses (50 mg/d) on days 4 to 8. Moxifloxacin (day 1), placebo (day 2), and granisetron [with placebo (day 2) or sunitinib (days 3 and 9)] were also administered. Treatment effects were evaluated by time-matched, serial electrocardiograms, and manually overread. RESULTS. Twenty-four of 48 patients were QT/PK evaluable. Moxifloxacin produced a time-matched, maximum mean placebo-adjusted corrected QT interval (QT(c)F) of 5.6 ms [90% confidence interval (CI), 1.9-9.3]. Sunitinib QT(c)F changes correlated with exposure, but not T(max). Maximum mean time-matched, placebo-adjusted QT(c)F was 9.6 ms (90% CI, 4.1-15.1) at steady state/therapeutic concentrations (day 3) and 15.4 ms (90% CI, 8.4-22.4) at supratherapeutic concentrations (day 9). No patient had a QT(c)F >500 ms. Concomitant granisetron produced no significant QT(c)F prolongation. Sunitinib-related adverse events were as previously described. CONCLUSIONS. Sunitinib has a dose-dependent effect on QT interval. The increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias must be weighed against the therapeutic benefit sunitinib provides to patients with advanced cancer.","19903787","IVD","19903786","2"
"Profiling critical cancer gene mutations in clinical tumor samples.","2009","BACKGROUND. Detection of critical cancer gene mutations in clinical tumor specimens may predict patient outcomes and inform treatment options; however, high-throughput mutation profiling remains underdeveloped as a diagnostic approach. We report the implementation of a genotyping and validation algorithm that enables robust tumor mutation profiling in the clinical setting. METHODOLOGY. We developed and implemented an optimized mutation profiling platform (""OncoMap"") to interrogate approximately 400 mutations in 33 known oncogenes and tumor suppressors, many of which are known to predict response or resistance to targeted therapies. The performance of OncoMap was analyzed using DNA derived from both frozen and FFPE clinical material in a diverse set of cancer types. A subsequent in-depth analysis was conducted on histologically and clinically annotated pediatric gliomas. The sensitivity and specificity of OncoMap were 93.8% and 100% in fresh frozen tissue; and 89.3% and 99.4% in FFPE-derived DNA. We detected known mutations at the expected frequencies in common cancers, as well as novel mutations in adult and pediatric cancers that are likely to predict heightened response or resistance to existing or developmental cancer therapies. OncoMap profiles also support a new molecular stratification of pediatric low-grade gliomas based on BRAF mutations that may have immediate clinical impact. CONCLUSIONS. Our results demonstrate the clinical feasibility of high-throughput mutation profiling to query a large panel of ""actionable"" cancer gene mutations. In the future, this type of approach may be incorporated into both cancer epidemiologic studies and clinical decision making to specify the use of many targeted anticancer agents.","19924296","IVD","19924296","1"
"Calcium-dependent increases in protein kinase-A activity in mouse retinal ganglion cells are mediated by multiple adenylate cyclases.","2009","Neurons undergo long term, activity dependent changes that are mediated by activation of second messenger cascades. In particular, calcium-dependent activation of the cyclic-AMP/Protein kinase A signaling cascade has been implicated in several developmental processes including cell survival, axonal outgrowth, and axonal refinement. The biochemical link between calcium influx and the activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway is primarily mediated through adenylate cyclases. Here, dual imaging of intracellular calcium concentration and PKA activity was used to assay the role of different classes of calcium-dependent adenylate cyclases (ACs) in the activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Surprisingly, depolarization-induced calcium-dependent PKA transients persist in barrelless mice lacking AC1, the predominant calcium-dependent adenylate cyclase in RGCs, as well as in double knockout mice lacking both AC1 and AC8. Furthermore, in a subset of RGCs, depolarization-induced PKA transients persist during the inhibition of all transmembrane adenylate cyclases. These results are consistent with the existence of a soluble adenylate cyclase that plays a role in calcium-dependent activation of the cAMP/PKA cascade in neurons.","19924297","IVD","19924296","2"
"KRAS mutations and resistance to EGFR-TKIs treatment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer: a meta-analysis of 22 studies.","2010","Epidemiologic studies have evaluated the association between KRAS mutations and resistance to the treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, results were inconclusive. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, we performed this meta-analysis. Systematic computerized searches of the PubMed and Medline databases (up to Jun 30, 2009) were performed. A total of 22 studies were included in the final meta-analysis, consisting of 1470 NSCLC patients, of whom 231 had KRAS mutations (16%). Current or former smokers had a higher frequency of KRAS mutations than never smokers (25% versus 6%; OR=4.36; P<0.01). Mutations were more common among adenocarcinoma than other histologies (26% versus 16%; OR=1.98; P<0.01). The objective response rate (ORR) of NSCLC patients with mutant KRAS was 3% (6/210), whereas the ORR of NSCLC patients with wild-type KRAS was 26% (287/1125). The overall pooled RR for ORR was 0.29 (95% CI: 0.18-0.47; P<0.01). Subgroup analyses were conducted on the basis of ethnicity and study treatment, all the results were not materially altered and did not draw different conclusions, indicating that our results were robust. In summary, this meta-analysis suggests that KRAS mutations may represent negative predictive biomarkers for tumor response in NSCLC patients treated with EGFR-TKIs. However, due to a mutually exclusive relationship between KRAS and EGFR mutation and no difference in survival between KRAS mutant/EGFR wild-type and KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type NSCLC, the clinical usefulness of KRAS mutation as a selection marker for EGFR-TKIs sensitivity in NSCLC is limited.","20022659","IIB","20022659","1"
"The ecology of algal biodiesel production.","2010","Sustainable energy production represents one of the most formidable problems of the 21st century, and plant-based biofuels offer significant promise. We summarize the potential advantages of using pond-grown microalgae as feedstocks relative to conventional terrestrial biofuel crop production. We show how pond-based algal biofuel production, which requires significantly less land area than agricultural crop-based biofuel systems, can offer additional ecological benefits by reducing anthropogenic pollutant releases to the environment and by requiring much lower water subsidies. We also demonstrate how key principles drawn from the science of ecology can be used to design efficient pond-based microalgal systems for the production of biodiesel fuels.","20022660","IIB","20022659","2"
"Vandetanib for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic hereditary medullary thyroid cancer.","2010","PURPOSE There is no effective therapy for patients with distant metastasis of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Activating mutations in the RET proto-oncogene cause hereditary MTC, which provides a strong therapeutic rationale for targeting RET kinase activity. This open-label, phase II study assessed the efficacy of vandetanib, a selective oral inhibitor of RET, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, and epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, in patients with advanced hereditary MTC. METHODS Patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic hereditary MTC received initial treatment with once-daily oral vandetanib 300 mg. The dose was adjusted additionally in some patients on the basis of observed toxicity until disease progression or any other withdrawal criterion was met. The primary assessment was objective tumor response (by RECIST [Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors]). Results Thirty patients received initial treatment with vandetanib 300 mg/d. On the basis of investigator assessments, 20% of patients (ie, six of 30 patients) experienced a confirmed partial response (median duration of response at data cutoff, 10.2 months). An additional 53% of patients (ie, 16 of 30 patients) experienced stable disease at >/= 24 weeks, which yielded a disease control rate of 73% (ie, 22 of 30 patients). In 24 patients, serum calcitonin levels showed a 50% or greater decrease from baseline that was maintained for at least 4 weeks; 16 patients showed a similar reduction in serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels. The most common adverse events were diarrhea (70%), rash (67%), fatigue (63%), and nausea (63%). CONCLUSION In this study, vandetanib demonstrated durable objective partial responses and disease control with a manageable adverse event profile. These results demonstrate that vandetanib may provide an effective therapeutic option in patients with advanced hereditary MTC, a rare disease for which there has been no effective therapy.","20065189","IA","20065189","1"
"Relationships between authorship contributions and authors' industry financial ties among oncology clinical trials.","2010","PURPOSE To test the hypothesis that authors who play key scientific roles in oncology clinical trials, and who therefore have increased influence over the design, analysis, interpretation or reporting of trials, are more likely than those who do not play such roles to have financial ties to industry. METHODS Data were abstracted from all trials (n = 235) of drugs or biologic agents published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology between January 1, 2006 and June 30, 2007. Article-level data included sponsorship, age group (adult v pediatric), phase, single versus multicenter, country (United States v other), and number of authors. Author-level data (n = 2,927) included financial ties (eg, employment, consulting) and performance of key scientific roles (ie, conception/design, analysis/interpretation, or manuscript writing). Associations between performance of key roles and financial ties, adjusting for article-level covariates, were examined using generalized linear mixed models. Results One thousand eight hundred eighty-one authors (64%) reported performing at least one key role, and 842 authors (29%) reported at least one financial tie. Authors who reported performing a key role were more likely than other authors to report financial ties to industry (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 4.3; 99% CI, 3.0 to 6.0; P < .0001). The association was stronger among trials with, compared with those without, industry funding (OR, 5.0 [99% CI, 3.4 to 7.5] v OR, 2.5 [99% CI, 1.3 to 4.8]), but was present regardless of sponsorship. CONCLUSION Authors who perform key roles in the conception and design, analysis, and interpretation, or reporting of oncology clinical trials are more likely than authors who do not perform such roles to have financial ties to industry.","20065190","IA","20065189","2"
"A phase II trial of erlotinib in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas and nonprogressive glioblastoma multiforme postradiation therapy.","2010","Patients with (a) recurrent malignant glioma (MG): glioblastoma (GBM) or recurrent anaplastic glioma (AG), and (b) nonprogressive (NP) GBM following radiation therapy (RT) were eligible. Primary objective for recurrent MG was progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS-6) and overall survival at 12 months for NP GBM post-RT. Secondary objectives for recurrent MGs were response, survival, assessment of toxicity, and pharmacokinetics (PKs). Treatment with enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs was not allowed. Patients received 150 mg/day erlotinib. Patients requiring surgery were treated 7 days prior to tumor removal for PK analysis and effects of erlotinib on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and intracellular signaling pathways. Ninety-six patients were evaluable (53 recurrent MG and 43 NP GBM); 5 patients were not evaluable for response. PFS-6 in recurrent GBM was 3% with a median PFS of 2 months; PFS-6 in recurrent AG was 27% with a median PFS of 2 months. Twelve-month survival was 57% in NP GBMs post-RT. Primary toxicity was dermatologic. The tissue-to-plasma ratio normalized to nanograms per gram dry weight for erlotinib and OSI-420 ranged from 25% to 44% and 30% to 59%, respectively, for pretreated surgical patients. No effect on EGFR or intratumoral signaling was seen. Patients with NP GBM post-RT who developed rash in cycle 1 had improved survival (P < .001). Single-agent activity of erlotinib is minimal for recurrent MGs and marginally beneficial following RT for NP GBM patients. Development of rash in cycle 1 correlates with survival in patients with NP GBM after RT.","20150372","IVD","20150372","1"
"Inherited predisposition to glioma.","2010","In gliomas, germline gene alterations play a significant role during malignant transformation of progenitor glial cells, at least for families with occurrence of multiple cancers or with specific hereditary cancer syndromes. Scientific evidence during the last few years has revealed several constitutive genetic abnormalities that may influence glioma formation. These germline abnormalities are manifested as either gene polymorphisms or hemizygous mutations of key regulatory genes that are involved either in DNA repair or in apoptosis. Such changes, among others, include hemizygous alterations of the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) and p53 genes that are involved in apoptotic pathways, and alterations in multiple DNA repair genes such as mismatch repair (MMR) genes, x-ray cross-complementary genes (XRCC), and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) genes. Subsequent cellular changes include somatic mutations in cell cycle regulatory genes and genes involved in angiogenesis and invasion, leading eventually to tumor formation in various stages. Future molecular diagnosis may identify new genomic regions that could harbor genes important for glioma predisposition and aid in the early diagnosis of these patients and genetic counseling of their families.","20150373","IVD","20150372","2"
"Classification and diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms according to the 2008 World Health Organization criteria.","2010","The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) were first recognized by William Dameshek in 1951. The classic MPNs were polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and chronic myelogenous leukemia. They were originally grouped together based on their shared phenotype of myeloproliferation. Since then, important discoveries have been made, identifying a central role of protein tyrosine kinases in the pathogenesis of these disorders. As such, the 2008 WHO diagnostic classification for myeloproliferative neoplasms has incorporated molecular markers with histologic, clinical and laboratory information into the diagnostic algorithms for the MPNs. Important changes include (1) the change of nomenclature of myeloproliferative disorder to myeloproliferative neoplasm emphasizing the clonal nature of these disorders; (2) the classification of mast cell disease as an MPN; (3) the reorganization of the eosinophilic disorders into a molecularly defined category of PDGFRA, PDGFRB and FGFR1-associated myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified; and (4) refinement of the diagnostic criteria for PV, ET and PMF incorporating recently described molecular markers, JAK2V617F, JAK2 exon 12 mutations and MPL mutations. This review focuses upon the important changes of the 2008 WHO diagnostic criteria for MPNs.","20191332","IB","20191332","1"
"Safe switching from dasatinib to nilotinib after a 1-month off-drug period for persistent pleural effusion in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase.","2010","The approval of two new tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors, nilotinib and dasatinib, has raised the issue of cross-intolerance. Evaluating the safety of interchanging TK inhibitors is particularly important for patients who are intolerant to one medication but are considered to be sensitive to the other. Available data are limited and it is unclear whether switching between TK inhibitors is possible without an off-drug period. We present two patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in whom, following the development of symptomatic pleural effusion, medications were safely switched from dasatinib to nilotinib after a 1-month off-drug period. The lymphocytosis and increased large granular lymphocyte count observed during dasatinib treatment also subsided after switching medications.","20191333","IB","20191332","2"
"Phase I/II study of combination therapy with sorafenib, idarubicin, and cytarabine in younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","2010","PURPOSE To determine the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of sorafenib, cytarabine, and idarubicin in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) younger than age 65 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS In the phase I part of the study, 10 patients with relapsed AML were treated with escalating doses of sorafenib with chemotherapy to establish the feasibility of the combination. We then treated 51 patients (median age, 53 years; range, 18 to 65 years) who had previously untreated AML with cytarabine at 1.5 g/m(2) by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion daily for 4 days (3 days if > 60 years of age), idarubicin at 12 mg/m(2) IV daily for 3 days, and sorafenib at 400 mg orally twice daily for 7 days. RESULTS Overall, 38 (75%) patients have achieved a complete remission (CR), including 14 (93%) of 15 patients with mutated FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3; the 15th patient had complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp]) and 24 (66%) of 36 patients with FLT3 wild-type (WT) disease (three additional FLT3-WT patients had CRp). FLT3-mutated patients were more likely to achieve a CR than FLT3-WT patients (P = .033). With a median follow-up of 54 weeks (range, 8 to 87 weeks), the probability of survival at 1 year is 74%. Among the FLT3-mutated patients, 10 have relapsed and five remain in CR with a median follow-up of 62 weeks (range, 10 to 76 weeks). Plasma inhibitory assay demonstrated an on-target effect on FLT3 kinase activity. CONCLUSION Sorafenib can be safely combined with chemotherapy, produces a high CR rate in FLT3-mutated patients, and inhibits FLT3 signaling.","20212254","IIIC","20212254","1"
"Effect of age on outcome of reduced-intensity hematopoietic cell transplantation for older patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission or with myelodysplastic syndrome.","2010","PURPOSE Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) primarily afflict older individuals. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is generally not offered because of concerns of excess morbidity and mortality. Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens allow increased use of allogeneic HCT for older patients. To define prognostic factors impacting long-term outcomes of RIC regimens in patients older than age 40 years with AML in first complete remission or MDS and to determine the impact of age, we analyzed data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). PATIENTS AND METHODS We reviewed data reported to the CIBMTR (1995 to 2005) on 1,080 patients undergoing RIC HCT. Outcomes analyzed included neutrophil recovery, incidence of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS Univariate analyses demonstrated no age group differences in NRM, grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, or relapse. Patients age 40 to 54, 55 to 59, 60 to 64, and > or = 65 years had 2-year survival rates as follows: 44% (95% CI, 37% to 52%), 50% (95% CI, 41% to 59%), 34% (95% CI, 25% to 43%), and 36% (95% CI, 24% to 49%), respectively, for patients with AML (P = .06); and 42% (95% CI, 35% to 49%), 35% (95% CI, 27% to 43%), 45% (95% CI, 36% to 54%), and 38% (95% CI, 25% to 51%), respectively, for patients with MDS (P = .37). Multivariate analysis revealed no significant impact of age on NRM, relapse, DFS, or OS (all P > .3). Greater HLA disparity adversely affected 2-year NRM, DFS, and OS. Unfavorable cytogenetics adversely impacted relapse, DFS, and OS. Better pre-HCT performance status predicted improved 2-year OS. CONCLUSION With these similar outcomes observed in older patients, we conclude that older age alone should not be considered a contraindication to HCT.","20212255","IIIC","20212254","2"
"Blockade of the MEK/ERK signalling cascade by AS703026, a novel selective MEK1/2 inhibitor, induces pleiotropic anti-myeloma activity in vitro and in vivo.","2010","This study investigated the cytotoxicity and mechanism of action of AS703026, a novel, selective, orally bioavailable MEK1/2 inhibitor, in human multiple myeloma (MM). AS703026 inhibited growth and survival of MM cells and cytokine-induced osteoclast differentiation more potently (9- to 10-fold) than AZD6244. Inhibition of proliferation induced by AS703026 was mediated by G0-G1 cell cycle arrest and was accompanied by reduction of MAF oncogene expression. AS703026 further induced apoptosis via caspase 3 and Poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage in MM cells, both in the presence or absence of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Importantly, AS703026 sensitized MM cells to a broad spectrum of conventional (dexamethasone, melphalan), novel or emerging (lenalidomide, perifosine, bortezomib, rapamycin) anti-MM therapies. Significant tumour growth reduction in AS703026- vs. vehicle-treated mice bearing H929 MM xenograft tumours correlated with downregulated pERK1/2, induced PARP cleavage, and decreased microvessels in vivo. Moreover, AS703026 (<200 nmol/l) was cytotoxic against the majority of tumour cells tested from patients with relapsed and refractory MM (84%), regardless of mutational status of RAS and BRAF genes. Importantly, BMSC-induced viability of MM patient cells was similarly blocked within the same dose range. Our results therefore support clinical evaluation of AS703026, alone or in combination with other anti-MM agents, to improve patient outcome.","20331454","VD","20331454","1"

This study preclinically evaluated the effects of the 'second generation' pan-HDAC inhibitor JNJ-26481585 on human multiple myeloma (MM) cells from established cell lines and primary MM samples (n=42). Molecular responses in both groups of MM cells included histone acetylation, a shift in Bcl2-family members towards proapoptotic bias, attenuation of growth and survival pathway activity and Hsp72 induction. Mcl-1 depletion and Hsp72 induction were the most reliable features observed in JNJ-26481585-treated primary MM samples. The drug alone effectively induced myeloma cell death at low nanomolar concentrations. In vitro combination of JNJ-26481585 with anti-myeloma therapeutic agents generally resulted In effects close to additivity.

"Phase II clinical trial of sorafenib in metastatic medullary thyroid cancer.","2010","PURPOSE. Mutations in the RET proto-oncogene and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) activity are critical in the pathogenesis of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor targeting Ret and VEGFR, showed antitumor activity in preclinical studies of MTC. PATIENTS AND METHODS. In this phase II trial of sorafenib in patients with advanced MTC, the primary end point was objective response. Secondary end points included toxicity assessment and response correlation with tumor markers, functional imaging, and RET mutations. Using a two-stage design, 16 or 25 patients were to be enrolled onto arms A (hereditary) and B (sporadic). Patients received sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily. RESULTS. Of 16 patients treated in arm B, one achieved partial response (PR; 6.3%; 95% CI, 0.2% to 30.2%), 14 had stable disease (SD; 87.5%; 95% CI, 61.7% to 99.5%), and one was nonevaluable. In a post hoc analysis of 10 arm B patients with progressive disease (PD) before study, one patient had PR of 21+ months, four patients had SD >or= 15 months, four patients had SD <or= 6 months, and one patient had clinical PD. Median progression-free survival was 17.9 months. Arm A was prematurely terminated because of slow accrual. Common adverse events (AEs) included diarrhea, hand-foot-skin reaction, rash, and hypertension. Although serious AEs were rare, one death was seen. Tumor markers decreased in the majority of patients, and RET mutations were detected in 10 of 12 sporadic MTCs analyzed. CONCLUSION. Sorafenib is reasonably well tolerated, with suggestion of clinical benefit for patients with sporadic MTC. Caution should be taken because of the rare but fatal toxicity potentially associated with sorafenib.","20368568","IA","20368568","1"
"Prognostic accuracy of computed tomography findings for patients with laryngeal cancer undergoing laryngectomy.","2010","PURPOSE. The indications for upfront laryngectomy in the management of laryngeal cancer are a functionless larynx and extralaryngeal extension. Practically, clinicians rely on imaging to predict which patients will have T4 disease. Our goal was to review the accuracy of preoperative computed tomography (CT) scanning in determining the necessity for initial laryngectomy for advanced laryngeal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS. In total, 107 consecutive untreated laryngectomy specimens with high-quality, preoperative CT imaging interpreted by our neuroradiologists were reviewed. Radiographic findings, including sclerosis, invasion, penetration, extralaryngeal spread, and subglottic extension were correlated with pathologic findings. CT images were not reinterpreted, since our purpose was to assess the original interpretations. RESULTS. CT imaging reported 23 cases of thyroid cartilage penetration and 27 cases of extralaryngeal spread. Pathology reported 12 cases of thyroid cartilage invasion, 29 cases of penetration, and 45 cases of extralaryngeal disease. CT imaging identified 17 (59%) of 29 cases of pathologically documented thyroid cartilage penetration and 22 (49%) of 45 cases of pathologically documented extralaryngeal spread. Pathologically proven extralaryngeal spread without thyroid cartilage penetration occurred in 18 (40%) of 45 cases. The positive predictive values for thyroid cartilage penetration and extralaryngeal spread were 74% and 81%. Sclerosis was of limited value in predicting thyroid cartilage invasion or penetration. Cricoid or arytenoid destruction predicted for thyroid cartilage penetration at rates of 57% and 63%. CONCLUSION. CT imaging has clear limitations when deciding whether there is thyroid cartilage penetration or extralaryngeal spread of advanced laryngeal cancer. Extralaryngeal spread without thyroid cartilage penetration was more common than expected. Alternate methods of pretreatment assessment are needed.","20368569","IA","20368568","2"

"A qualitative approach to primary care research: the long interview.","1991","Qualitative research methods offer useful complements to the traditional epidemiologic approaches most commonly used by primary care researchers. Narrative texts generated through open-ended interviews are one form of qualitative data that may provide useful insights into primary care issues that are otherwise overlooked by more structured designs. This paper presents a step-by-step process for conducting a long interview, a qualitative approach with distinct potential for primary care research. Advantages and limitations of the long interview and its relationship to other qualitative methods are also discussed.","2037216","IVD","2037215","2"
"Identification of biomarkers in human head and neck tumor cell lines that predict for in vitro sensitivity to gefitinib.","2009","Potential biomarkers were identified for in vitro sensitivity to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib in head and neck cancer. Gefitinib sensitivity was determined in cell lines, followed by transcript profiling coupled with a novel pathway analysis approach. Eleven cell lines were highly sensitive to gefitinib (inhibitor concentration required to give 50% growth inhibition [GI(50)] < 1 microM), three had intermediate sensitivity (GI(50) 1-7 microM), and six were resistant (GI(50) > 7 microM); an exploratory principal component analysis revealed a separation between the genomic profiles of sensitive and resistant cell lines. Subsequently, a hypothesis-driven analysis of Affymetrix data (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) revealed higher mRNA levels for E-cadherin (CDH1); transforming growth factor, alpha (TGF-alpha); amphiregulin (AREG); FLJ22662; EGFR; p21-activated kinase 6 (PAK6); glutathione S-transferase Pi (GSTP1); and ATP-binding cassette, subfamily C, member 5 (ABCC5) in sensitive versus resistant cell lines. A hypothesis-free analysis identified 46 gene transcripts that were strongly differentiated, seven of which had a known association with EGFR and head and neck cancer (human EGF receptor 3 [HER3], TGF-alpha, CDH1, EGFR, keratin 16 [KRT16], fibroblast growth factor 2 [FGF2], and cortactin [CTTN]). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay analysis confirmed Affymetrix data, and EGFR gene mutation, amplification, and genomic gain correlated strongly with gefitinib sensitivity. We identified biomarkers that predict for in vitro responsiveness to gefitinib, seven of which have known association with EGFR and head and neck cancer. These in vitro predictive biomarkers may have potential utility in the clinic and warrant further investigation.","20443891","VD","20443891","1"
"Inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms by a novel antibacterial envelope for use with implantable cardiac devices.","2009","Biofilm formation on representative implantable medical devices using a known human pathogen (Staphylococcus aureus) was significantly reduced (p < 0.01) at all time points measured (24,48, and 72 hours) by employing a novel antibacterial envelope (AIGIS Rx). The result was demonstrated using a standard US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) bioreactor model and the results were confirmed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The antibacterial envelope used in the study is coated with a proprietary combination broad spectrum antibiotics (rifampin and minocycline) embedded in a resorbable polymeric coating. The antibiotics are designed to elute out of the coating over a multi-day period for controlled, site-specific drug delivery. The infection rate for patients receiving pacemakers and defibrillators is increasing faster than the rate of new implants and the growing resistance of S. aureus strains suggests that conventional, systemic antibiotic prophylaxis may have limited future utility. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that bacterial biofilms result in infections of implantable medical devices. These findings demonstrate the in vitro efficacy of a new means to address potential biofilm-derived Hospital Acquired Infections (HAIs) related to implantable medical devices composed of titanium inclusive of pacemakers and defibrillators by means of a locally delivered, low dose, combination antibacterial treatment.","20443892","VD","20443891","2"
"Neratinib, an irreversible pan-ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor: results of a phase II trial in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.","2010","PURPOSE. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have had a significant impact on non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) outcomes, particularly for patients with EGFR mutations. Resistance emerges after 9 to 12 months, primarily mediated by the T790M resistance mutation. We studied neratinib, an irreversible pan-ErbB TKI that may overcome T790M. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Patients with advanced NSCLC underwent EGFR sequencing of available tumor tissue at enrollment. Those with > or = 12 weeks of prior TKI therapy were placed in arm A if they were EGFR mutation positive or arm B if they were wild-type. Arm C included TKI-naïve patients with adenocarcinoma and light smoking histories (< or = 20 pack-years). All patients received daily oral neratinib, initially at 320 mg but subsequently reduced to 240 mg because of excessive diarrhea. The primary end point was objective response rate (RR). RESULTS. One-hundred sixty-seven patients were treated: 91 in arm A, 48 in arm B, and 28 in arm C. Diarrhea was the most common toxicity; grade 3 incidence was 50% at 320 mg but improved to 25% after dose reduction. The RR was 3% in arm A and zero in arms B and C. No patients with known T790M responded. Notably, three of four patients with an exon 18 G719X EGFR mutation had a partial response and the fourth had stable disease lasting 40 weeks. CONCLUSION. Neratinib had low activity in patients with prior benefit from TKIs and in TKI-naïve patients, potentially because of insufficient bioavailability from diarrhea-imposed dose limitation. Responses were seen in patients with the rare G719X EGFR mutation, highlighting the importance of obtaining comprehensive genetic information on trials of targeted agents.","20479403","IB","20479403","1"
"Lack of efficacy of bevacizumab plus irinotecan in children with recurrent malignant glioma and diffuse brainstem glioma: a Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium study.","2010","PURPOSE. A phase II study of bevacizumab (BVZ) plus irinotecan (CPT-11) was conducted in children with recurrent malignant glioma (MG) and intrinsic brainstem glioma (BSG). PATIENTS AND METHODS. Eligible patients received two doses of BVZ intravenously (10 mg/kg) 2 weeks apart and then BVZ plus CPT-11 every 2 weeks until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 2 years of therapy. Correlative studies included diffusion weighted and T1 dynamic contrast-enhanced permeability imaging, BVZ pharmacokinetics, and estimation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) phosphorylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after single-agent BVZ. RESULTS. Thirty-one evaluable patients received a median of two courses of BVZ plus CPT-11 (range, 1 to 19). No sustained responses were observed in either stratum. Median time to progression for all 34 eligible patients enrolled was 127 days for MG and 71 days for BSG. Progression-free survival rates at 6 months were 41.8% and 9.7% for MG and BSG, respectively. Toxicities related to BVZ included grade 1 to 3 fatigue in seven patients, grade 1 to 2 hypertension in seven patients, grade 1 CNS hemorrhage in four patients, and grade 4 CNS ischemia in two patients. The mean diffusion ratio decreased after two doses of BVZ in patients with MG only. Vascular permeability parameters did not change significantly after therapy in either stratum. Inhibition of VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in PBMC was detected in eight of 11 patients after BVZ exposure. CONCLUSION. BVZ plus CPT-11 was well-tolerated but had minimal efficacy in children with recurrent malignant glioma and brainstem glioma.","20479404","IB","20479403","2"
"RG7204 (PLX4032), a selective BRAFV600E inhibitor, displays potent antitumor activity in preclinical melanoma models.","2010","The BRAF(V600E) mutation is common in several human cancers, especially melanoma. RG7204 (PLX4032) is a small-molecule inhibitor of BRAF(V600E) kinase activity that is in phase II and phase III clinical testing. Here, we report a preclinical characterization of the antitumor activity of RG7204 using established in vitro and in vivo models of malignant melanoma. RG7204 potently inhibited proliferation and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase and ERK phosphorylation in a panel of tumor cell lines, including melanoma cell lines expressing BRAF(V600E) or other mutant BRAF proteins altered at codon 600. In contrast, RG7204 lacked activity in cell lines that express wild-type BRAF or non-V600 mutations. In several tumor xenograft models of BRAF(V600E)-expressing melanoma, we found that RG7204 treatment caused partial or complete tumor regressions and improved animal survival, in a dose-dependent manner. There was no toxicity observed in any dose group in any of the in vivo models tested. Our findings offer evidence of the potent antitumor activity of RG7204 against melanomas harboring the mutant BRAF(V600E) gene.","20551065","VD","20551065","1"
"Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-1 as a target for passive cancer immunotherapy.","2010","Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) is an inhibitor of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling that is overexpressed in most lung and esophageal cancers. Here, we show its utility as a serum biomarker for a wide range of human cancers, and we offer evidence favoring the potential application of anti-DKK1 antibodies for cancer treatment. Using an original ELISA system, high levels of DKK1 protein were found in serologic samples from 906 patients with cancers of the pancreas, stomach, liver, bile duct, breast, and cervix, which also showed elevated expression levels of DKK1. Additionally, anti-DKK1 antibody inhibited the invasive activity and the growth of cancer cells in vitro and suppressed the growth of engrafted tumors in vivo. Tumor tissues treated with anti-DKK1 displayed significant fibrotic changes and a decrease in viable cancer cells without apparent toxicity in mice. Our findings suggest DKK1 as a serum biomarker for screening against a variety of cancers, and anti-DKK1 antibodies as potential theranostic tools for diagnosis and treatment of cancer.","20551066","VD","20551065","2"
"HER3 and downstream pathways are involved in colonization of brain metastases from breast cancer.","2010","INTRODUCTION. Metastases to the brain from breast cancer have a high mortality, and basal-like breast cancers have a propensity for brain metastases. However, the mechanisms that allow cells to colonize the brain are unclear. METHODS. We used morphology, immunohistochemistry, gene expression and somatic mutation profiling to analyze 39 matched pairs of primary breast cancers and brain metastases, 22 unmatched brain metastases of breast cancer, 11 non-breast brain metastases and 6 autopsy cases of patients with breast cancer metastases to multiple sites, including the brain. RESULTS. Most brain metastases were triple negative and basal-like. The brain metastases over-expressed one or more members of the HER family and in particular HER3 was significantly over-expressed relative to matched primary tumors. Brain metastases from breast and other primary sites, and metastases to multiple organs in the autopsied cases, also contained somatic mutations in EGFR, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS or PIK3CA. This paralleled the frequent activation of AKT and MAPK pathways. In particular, activation of the MAPK pathway was increased in the brain metastases compared to the primary tumors. CONCLUSIONS. Deregulated HER family receptors, particularly HER3, and their downstream pathways are implicated in colonization of brain metastasis. The need for HER family receptors to dimerize for activation suggests that tumors may be susceptible to combinations of anti-HER family inhibitors, and may even be effective in the absence of HER2 amplification (that is, in triple negative/basal cancers). However, the presence of activating mutations in PIK3CA, HRAS, KRAS and NRAS suggests the necessity for also specifically targeting downstream molecules.","20604919","IVD","20604919","1"
"Constraints to virus infection in Nicotiana benthamiana plants transformed with a potyvirus amplicon.","2010","BACKGROUND. Plant genomes have been transformed with full-length cDNA copies of viral genomes, giving rise to what has been called 'amplicon' systems, trying to combine the genetic stability of transgenic plants with the elevated replication rate of plant viruses. However, amplicons' performance has been very variable regardless of the virus on which they are based. This has boosted further interest in understanding the underlying mechanisms that cause this behavior differences, and in developing strategies to control amplicon expression. RESULTS. Nicotiana benthamiana plants were transformed with an amplicon consisting of a full-length cDNA of the potyvirus Plum pox virus (PPV) genome modified to include a GFP reporter gene. Amplicon expression exhibited a great variability among different transgenic lines and even among different plants of the same line. Plants of the line 10.6 initially developed without signs of amplicon expression, but at different times some of them started to display sporadic infection foci in leaves approaching maturity. The infection progressed systemically, but at later times the infected plants recovered and returned to an amplicon-inactive state. The failure to detect virus-specific siRNAs in 10.6 plants before amplicon induction and after recovery suggested that a strong amplicon-specific RNA silencing is not established in these plants. However, the coexpression of extra viral silencing suppressors caused some amplicon activation, suggesting that a low level of RNA silencing could be contributing to maintain amplicon repression in the 10.6 plants. The resistance mechanisms that prevent amplicon-derived virus infection were also active against exogenous PPV introduced by mechanical inoculation or grafting, but did not affect other viruses. Amplicon-derived PPV was able to spread into wild type scions grafted in 10.6 rootstocks that did not display signs of amplicon expression, suggesting that resistance has little effect on virus movement. CONCLUSIONS. Our results suggest that amplicon-derived virus infection is limited in this particular transgenic line by a combination of factors, including the presumed low efficiency of the conversion from the transgene transcript to replicable viral RNA, and also by the activation of RNA silencing and other defensive responses of the plant, which are not completely neutralized by viral suppressors.","20604920","IVD","20604919","2"
"Associations between imatinib resistance conferring mutations and Philadelphia positive clonal cytogenetic evolution in CML.","2010","In patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), resistance against imatinib is associated with mutations in the kinase domain (KD) of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene and/or with additional chromosomal abnormalities (ACAs) secondary to the Philadelphia chromosome. To evaluate associations between these molecular and cytogenetic events, we correlated cytogenetic data with results of KD mutation analysis in 205 CML patients with acquired resistance to imatinib (100 females, 105 males, 17.9-90.3 years). In 79/205 patients (38.5%), at least one KD mutation was detected; in 13/79 (16.5%) even two different mutations were observed. A second KD mutation was frequent in cases with G250E (4/9), E255V (1/3), T315I (5/18), F317L (2/7), F359C/V (4/7), or H396R (2/3), but was never detected in cases with V299L (n = 3) or Y253H (n = 4). With respect to cytogenetics, ACAs were identified in 76/205 patients (37.1%), in 29 (36.7%) together with KD mutations. ACAs were frequent in cases with E255V (2/3), T315I (8/18), F317L (4/7), F359C/V (4/7), or H396R (2/3), but rare in those with M351T (1/9). Therefore, some KD mutations (e.g., T315I) might be associated with higher genetic instability paving the way to additional cytogenetic and molecular genetic events.","20607847","IVD","20607847","1"

Following the discovery that mutant KRAS is associated with resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies, the tumours of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are now profiled for seven KRAS mutations before receiving cetuximab or panitumumab. However, most patients with KRAS wild-type tumours still do not respond. We studied the effect of other downstream mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab in, to our knowledge, the largest cohort to date of patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy in the pre-KRAS selection era. FUNDING. Belgian Federation against Cancer (Stichting tegen Kanker). METHODS. 1022 tumour DNA samples (73 from fresh-frozen and 949 from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue) from patients treated with cetuximab between 2001 and 2008 were gathered from 11 centres in seven European countries. 773 primary tumour samples had sufficient quality DNA and were included in mutation frequency analyses; mass spectrometry genotyping of tumour samples for KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA was done centrally. We analysed objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival in molecularly defined subgroups of the 649 chemotherapy-refractory patients treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy. FINDINGS. 40.0% (299/747) of the tumours harboured a KRAS mutation, 14.5% (108/743) harboured a PIK3CA mutation (of which 68.5% [74/108] were located in exon 9 and 20.4% [22/108] in exon 20), 4.7% (36/761) harboured a BRAF mutation, and 2.6% (17/644) harboured an NRAS mutation. KRAS mutants did not derive benefit compared with wild types, with a response rate of 6.7% (17/253) versus 35.8% (126/352; odds ratio [OR] 0.13, 95% CI 0.07-0.22; p<0.0001), a median PFS of 12 weeks versus 24 weeks (hazard ratio [HR] 1.98, 1.66-2.36; p<0.0001), and a median overall survival of 32 weeks versus 50 weeks (1.75, 1.47-2.09; p<0.0001). In KRAS wild types, carriers of BRAF and NRAS mutations had a significantly lower response rate than did BRAF and NRAS wild types, with a response rate of 8.3% (2/24) in carriers of BRAF mutations versus 38.0% in BRAF wild types (124/326; OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.51; p=0.0012); and 7.7% (1/13) in carriers of NRAS mutations versus 38.1% in NRAS wild types (110/289; OR 0.14, 0.007-0.70; p=0.013). PIK3CA exon 9 mutations had no effect, whereas exon 20 mutations were associated with a worse outcome compared with wild types, with a response rate of 0.0% (0/9) versus 36.8% (121/329; OR 0.00, 0.00-0.89; p=0.029), a median PFS of 11.5 weeks versus 24 weeks (HR 2.52, 1.33-4.78; p=0.013), and a median overall survival of 34 weeks versus 51 weeks (3.29, 1.60-6.74; p=0.0057). Multivariate analysis and conditional inference trees confirmed that, if KRAS is not mutated, assessing BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations (in that order) gives additional information about outcome. Objective response rates in our series were 24.4% in the unselected population, 36.3% in the KRAS wild-type selected population, and 41.2% in the KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 wild-type population. INTERPRETATION. While confirming the negative effect of KRAS mutations on outcome after cetuximab, we show that BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations are significantly associated with a low response rate. Objective response rates could be improved by additional genotyping of BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations in a KRAS wild-type population.","20619739","IIB","20619739","1"

Objective response rates in our series were 24.4% in the unselected population, 36.3% in the KRAS wild-type selected population, and 41.2% in the KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 wild-type population. INTERPRETATION. While confirming the negative effect of KRAS mutations on outcome after cetuximab, we show that BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations are significantly associated with a low response rate. Objective response rates could be improved by additional genotyping of BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations in a KRAS wild-type population.","20619739","VD","20619739","1"
"Taking off the brakes: T cell immunity in the liver.","2010","In lymphatic tissue, professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs), mature after sensing microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), and subsequently activate T cell immunity. Non-pathogenic MAMPs, derived for example from commensal bacteria, are delivered to the liver from the gastrointestinal tract via the portal vein. However, in contrast to splenic DCs, PRRs-expressing liver APCs induce T cell tolerance rather than immunity. This is explained partly by the distinct effects of PRRs on the maturation of liver APCs: these cells activate T cell immunity only when PRRs stimulation is accompanied by microbial infection through mechanisms that are not employed by DCs in lymphatic tissue. Understanding the molecular basis of T cell tolerance and immunity in the liver may help develop novel immune therapy for persistent viral infection or liver cancer.","20619740","VD","20619739","2"
"Incidence of the V600K mutation among melanoma patients with BRAF mutations, and potential therapeutic response to the specific BRAF inhibitor PLX4032.","2010","Activating mutations in BRAF kinase are common in melanomas. Clinical trials with PLX4032, the mutant-BRAF inhibitor, show promising preliminary results in patients selected for the presence of V600E mutation. However, activating V600K mutation is the other most common mutation, yet patients with this variant are currently excluded from the PLX4032 trials. Here we present evidence that a patient bearing the BRAF V600K mutation responded remarkably to PLX4032, suggesting that clinical trials should include all patients with activating BRAF V600E/K mutations.","20630094","IVD","20630094","1"
"A prospective study of symptoms, function, and medication use during acute illness in nursing home residents: design, rationale and cohort description.","2010","BACKGROUND. Nursing home residents are at high risk for developing acute illnesses. Compared with community dwelling adults, nursing home residents are often more frail, prone to multiple medical problems and symptoms, and are at higher risk for adverse outcomes from acute illnesses. In addition, because of polypharmacy and the high burden of chronic disease, nursing home residents are particularly vulnerable to disruptions in transitions of care such as medication interruptions in the setting of acute illness. In order to better estimate the effect of acute illness on nursing home residents, we have initiated a prospective cohort which will allow us to observe patterns of acute illnesses and the consequence of acute illnesses, including symptoms and function, among nursing home residents. We also aim to examine the patterns of medication interruption, and identify patient, provider and environmental factors that influence continuity of medication prescribing at different points of care transition. METHODS. This is a prospective cohort of nursing home residents residing in two nursing homes in a metropolitan area. Baseline characteristics including age, gender, race, and comorbid conditions are recorded. Participants are followed longitudinally for a planned period of 3 years. We record acute illness incidence and characteristics, and measure symptoms including depression, pain, withdrawal symptoms, and function using standardized scales. RESULTS. 76 nursing home residents have been followed for a median of 666 days to date. At baseline, mean age of residents was 74.4 (+/- 11.9); 32% were female; 59% were white. The most common chronic conditions were dementia (41%), depression (38%), congestive heart failure (25%) and chronic obstructive lung disease (27%). Mean pain score was 4.7 (+/- 3.6) on a scale of 0 to 10; Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) score was 5.2 (+/- 4.4). During follow up, 138 acute illness episodes were identified, for an incidence of 1.5 (SD 2.0) episodes per resident per year; 74% were managed in the nursing home and 26% managed in the acute care setting. CONCLUSION. In this report, we describe the conceptual model and methods of designing a longitudinal cohort to measure acute illness patterns and symptoms among nursing home residents, and describe the characteristics of our cohort at baseline. In our planned analysis, we will further estimate the effect of the use and interruption of medications on withdrawal and relapse symptoms and illness outcomes.","20630095","IVD","20630094","2"
"Pharmacodynamic characterization of the efficacy signals due to selective BRAF inhibition with PLX4032 in malignant melanoma.","2010","PURPOSE. About 65% to 70% of melanomas harbor a mutation in v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) that causes the steady-state activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). We sought to investigate the efficacy of PLX4032 (BRAF inhibitor) to identify patterns/predictors of response/resistance and to study the effects of BRAF in melanoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. Well-characterized melanoma cell lines, including several with acquired drug resistance, were exposed to PLX4032. Growth inhibition, phosphosignaling, cell cycle, apoptosis, and gene expression analyses were performed before and after exposure to drug. RESULTS. Using a growth-adjusted inhibitory concentration of 50% cutoff of 1 microM, 13 of 35 cell lines were sensitive to PLX4032, 16 resistant, and 6 intermediate (37%, 46%, and 17% respectively). PLX4032 caused growth inhibition, G(0)/G(1) arrest, and restored apoptosis in the sensitive cell lines. A BRAF mutation predicted for but did not guarantee a response, whereas a neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog mutation or wild-type BRAF conferred resistance. Cells with concurrent BRAF mutations and melanocortin 1 receptor germ line variants and/or a more differentiated melanocyte genotype had a preferential response. Acquired PLX4032 resistance reestablishes ERK signaling, promotes a nonmelanocytic genotype, and is associated with an increase in the gene expression of certain metallothioneins and mediators of angiogenesis. CONCLUSIONS. PLX4032 has robust activity in BRAF mutated melanoma. The preclinical use of this molecule identifies criteria for its proper clinical application, describes patterns of and reasons for response/resistance, and affords insight into the role of a BRAF mutation in melanoma.","20689758","VD","20689758","1"
"Ron receptor tyrosine kinase activation confers resistance to tamoxifen in breast cancer cell lines.","2010","Although tamoxifen treatment is associated with improved survival in patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast tumors, resistance remains an important clinical obstacle. Signaling through growth factor signaling pathways, in particular through receptor tyrosine kinases, has been demonstrated to confer tamoxifen resistance in an estradiol-independent manner. The Ron receptor tyrosine kinase, a member of the c-Met family of receptors, is expressed in a number of human epithelial tumors, and elevated expression of Ron is associated with poor prognosis in women with breast cancer. In this report, we evaluated the role of Ron receptor activation in conferring resistance to tamoxifen in human and murine breast cancer cell lines. Activation of Ron by its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (HGFL) was associated with partial rescue from tamoxifen-induced growth inhibition in Ron-expressing cell lines. Western analysis revealed that treatment of the T47D human breast cancer cell line with tamoxifen and HGFL was associated with increased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1/2 and phosphorylation of serine residue 118 of ER. Expression of ER-dependent genes was increased in cells treated with tamoxifen and HGFL by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. All of these effects were inhibited by treatment with either a Ron-neutralizing antibody or a MEK1 inhibitor, suggesting the specificity of the effect to Ron, and the involvement of the MAPK 1/2 signaling pathway. In summary, these results illustrate a novel connection between the Ron receptor tyrosine kinase and an important mechanism of tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer.","20689759","VD","20689758","2"
"Phase IIB trial of oral Midostaurin (PKC412), the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor (FLT3) and multi-targeted kinase inhibitor, in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome with either wild-type or mutated FLT3.","2010","PURPOSE. Mutations leading to constitutive activation of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor (FLT3) occur in blasts of 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Midostaurin (PKC412; N-benzoylstaurosporin) is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with demonstrated activity in patients with AML/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with FLT3 mutations. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Ninety-five patients with AML or MDS with either wild-type (n = 60) or mutated (n = 35) FLT3 were randomly assigned to receive oral midostaurin at 50 or 100 mg twice daily. The drug was discontinued in the absence of response at 2 months, disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity. Response was defined as complete response, partial response (PR), hematologic improvement, or reduction in peripheral blood or bone marrow blasts by ? 50% (BR). RESULTS. The rate of BR for the population in whom efficacy could be assessed (n = 92) was 71% in patients with FLT3-mutant and 42% in patients with FLT3 wild-type. One PR occurred in a patient with FLT3-mutant receiving the 100-mg dose regimen. Both doses were well-tolerated; there were no differences in toxicity or response rate according to the dose of midostaurin. CONCLUSION. These results suggest that midostaurin has hematologic activity in both patients with FLT3-mutant and wild-type. The degree of clinical activity observed supports additional studies that combine midostaurin and other agents such as chemotherapy especially in FLT3-mutant AML.","20733134","IIIC","20733134","1"
"Randomized phase II study of docetaxel and prednisone with or without OGX-011 in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.","2010","PURPOSE. To determine the clinical activity of OGX-011, an antisense inhibitor of clusterin, in combination with docetaxel/prednisone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive docetaxel/prednisone either with (arm A) or without (arm B) OGX-011 640 mg intravenously weekly. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline of ? 50% from baseline, with the experimental therapy being considered of interest if the proportion of patients with a PSA decline was more than 60%. Secondary end points were objective response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and changes in serum clusterin. RESULTS. Eighty-two patients were accrued, 41 to each arm. OGX-011 adverse effects included rigors and fevers. After cycle 1, median serum clusterin decreased by 26% in arm A and increased by 0.9% in arm B (P < .001). PSA declined by ? 50% in 58% of patients in arm A and 54% in arm B. Partial response occurred in 19% and 25% of patients in arms A and B, respectively. Median PFS and OS times were 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.3 to 8.8 months) and 23.8 months (95% CI, 16.2 months to not reached), respectively, in arm A and 6.1 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 8.6 months) and 16.9 months (95% CI, 12.8 to 25.8 months), respectively, in arm B. Baseline factors associated with improved OS on exploratory multivariate analysis were an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.27; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.51), presence of bone or lymph node metastases only (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.79), and treatment assignment to OGX-011 (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.87). CONCLUSION. Treatment with OGX-011 and docetaxel was well tolerated with evidence of biologic effect and was associated with improved survival.

"Comparison of p53 and epidermal growth factor receptor gene status between primary tumors and lymph node metastases in non-small cell lung cancers.","2011","BACKGROUND. To obtain insight into the cancer progression and metastatic process, we evaluate p53/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) somatic aberrations in non-small-cell lung cancers to compare accumulated genetic alterations between primary tumors and lymph node metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A total of 56 primary lung cancers with corresponding lymph node metastases were identified to investigate somatic mutations and altered expressions of p53 and EGFR for clonality assessment. Genomic DNA was extracted from macrodissected cells of paraffin-embedded primary tumor and metastatic lymph node tissues. Overexpression and somatic mutations in exons of p53 (exons 5-8) and tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR (exons 18-21) were examined by immunohistochemical staining and DNA sequencing, respectively. RESULTS. p53 and EGFR mutation/overexpression status were different between primary tumors and lymph node metastases in 5.4/7.2% and 28.6/33.9%, respectively. In most cases, the p53 and EGFR mutations usually preceded lymph node metastasis, and these gene statuses in the primary cancer and their lymph node metastasis were concordant (92.9 and 69.6%, respectively), which further supported the hypothesis that when these p53 mutations occur before the establishment of lymph node metastasis, they subsequently persist in the metastatic nodes. The expressions of p53 and EGFR showed 7.1 and 33.9% discordance in that order. CONCLUSIONS. Our results reveal that p53 and EGFR mutations usually precede lymph node metastasis. The higher prevalence of EGFR heterogeneity existing in the primary tumor is not reflected in all lymph node metastasis and thus might have therapeutic implications when adjuvant therapy is considered.","20811949","IVD","20811949","1"
"Lipid metabolism in long-lived families: the Leiden Longevity Study.","2011","Mechanisms underlying the variation in human life expectancy are largely unknown, but lipid metabolism and especially lipoprotein size was suggested to play an important role in longevity. We have performed comprehensive lipid phenotyping in the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS). By applying multiple logistic regression analysis we tested for the first time the effects of parameters in lipid metabolism (i.e., classical serum lipids, lipoprotein particle sizes, and apolipoprotein E levels) on longevity independent of each other. Parameters in lipid metabolism were measured in offspring of nonagenarian siblings from 421 families of the LLS (n?=?1,664; mean age, 59 years) and in the partners of the offspring as population controls (n?=?711; mean age, 60 years). In the initial model, where lipoprotein particles sizes, classical serum lipids and apolipoprotein E were included, offspring had larger low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle sizes (p?=?0.017), and lower triglyceride levels (p?=?0.026), indicating that they displayed a more beneficial lipid profile. After backwards regression only LDL size (p?=?0.014) and triglyceride levels (p?=?0.05) were associated with offspring from long-lived families. Sex-specific backwards regression analysis revealed that LDL particle sizes were associated with male longevity (increase in log odds ratio (OR) per unit?=?0.21; p?=?0.023). Triglyceride levels (decrease OR per unit?=?0.22; p?=?0.01), but not LDL particle size, were associated with female longevity. Due to the analysis of a comprehensive lipid profile, we confirmed an important role of lipid metabolism in human longevity, with LDL size and triglyceride levels as major predicting factors.","20811950","IVD","20811949","2"
"Inhibition of mutated, activated BRAF in metastatic melanoma.","2010","BACKGROUND. The identification of somatic mutations in the gene encoding the serine-threonine protein kinase B-RAF (BRAF) in the majority of melanomas offers an opportunity to test oncogene-targeted therapy for this disease. METHODS. We conducted a multicenter, phase 1, dose-escalation trial of PLX4032 (also known as RG7204), an orally available inhibitor of mutated BRAF, followed by an extension phase involving the maximum dose that could be administered without adverse effects (the recommended phase 2 dose). Patients received PLX4032 twice daily until they had disease progression. Pharmacokinetic analysis and tumor-response assessments were conducted in all patients. In selected patients, tumor biopsy was performed before and during treatment to validate BRAF inhibition. RESULTS. A total of 55 patients (49 of whom had melanoma) were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase, and 32 additional patients with metastatic melanoma who had BRAF with the V600E mutation were enrolled in the extension phase. The recommended phase 2 dose was 960 mg twice daily, with increases in the dose limited by grade 2 or 3 rash, fatigue, and arthralgia. In the dose-escalation cohort, among the 16 patients with melanoma whose tumors carried the V600E BRAF mutation and who were receiving 240 mg or more of PLX4032 twice daily, 10 had a partial response and 1 had a complete response. Among the 32 patients in the extension cohort, 24 had a partial response and 2 had a complete response. The estimated median progression-free survival among all patients was more than 7 months.

"Underinsurance among children in the United States.","2010","BACKGROUND. Recent interest in policy regarding children's health insurance has focused on expanding coverage. Less attention has been devoted to the question of whether insurance sufficiently meets children's needs. METHODS. We estimated underinsurance among U.S. children on the basis of data from the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health (sample size, 91,642 children) regarding parents' or guardians' judgments of whether their children's insurance covered needed services and providers and reasonably covered costs. Data on adequacy were combined with data on continuity of insurance coverage to classify children as never insured during the past year, sometimes insured during the past year, continuously insured but inadequately covered (i.e., underinsured), and continuously insured and adequately covered. We examined the association between this classification and five overall indicators of health care access and quality: delayed or forgone care, difficulty obtaining needed care from a specialist, no preventive care, no developmental screening at a preventive visit, and care not meeting the criteria of a medical home. RESULTS. We estimated that in 2007, 11 million children were without health insurance for all or part of the year, and 22.7% of children with continuous insurance coverage--14.1 million children--were underinsured. Older children, Hispanic children, children in fair or poor health, and children with special health care needs were more likely to be underinsured. As compared with children who were continuously and adequately insured, uninsured and underinsured children were more likely to have problems with health care access and quality. CONCLUSIONS.

National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group PA.3 (NCIC CTG PA.3) was a phase 3 study (n = 569) that demonstrated benefits for overall survival and progression-free survival with the addition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) erlotinib to gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic carcinoma (APC). Mutation status of the v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) and EGFR gene copy number (GCN) were evaluated as predictive markers in 26% of patients who had tumor samples available for analysis. METHODS. KRAS mutation status was evaluated by direct sequencing of exon 2, and EGFR GCN was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. The results were correlated with survival, which was the primary endpoint of the trial. RESULTS. KRAS analysis was successful in 117 patients, and EGFR FISH analysis was successful in 107 patients. KRAS mutations were identified in 92 patients (78.6%), and EGFR amplification or high polysomy (FISH-positive results) was identified in 50 patients (46.7%). The hazard ratio of death between gemcitabine/erlotinib and gemcitabine/placebo was 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-1.57) for patients with wild-type KRAS and 1.07 (95% CI, 0.68-1.66) for patients with mutant KRAS (P value for interaction = .38), and the hazard ratio was 0.6 (95% CI, 0.34-1.07) for FISH-negative patients and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.49-1.65) for FISH-positive patients (P value for interaction = .32).

"Clinical and molecular features of papillary thyroid cancer in adolescents and young adults.","2011","BACKGROUND. Age disparities in thyroid cancer incidence and outcome among adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with thyroid cancer are under reported. In this study, the authors compared the molecular and clinical features of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) in AYAs with the same features among patients in other age groups. METHODS. One thousand eleven patients underwent initial treatment for PTC at the University of California at San Francisco. Patients were subdivided into 2 age groups: ages 15 to 39 years (the AYA group) and aged ?40 years. Demographic, clinical, and survival data in the cohort also were compared with data from the National Cancer Instsitute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. In a subset of the study cohort, the primary tumors were analyzed by genome-wide expression analyses, genotyping for common somatic mutations, and pathway-specific gene expression arrays between the age groups. RESULTS. The percentage of women and the lymph node metastasis rate were significantly higher in the AYA group. In the AYA group, the rate of distant metastasis was lower. Disease-free survival and median overall survival were significantly higher in the AYA group. The better survival in AYA patients also was apparent in the national SEER data. An unsupervised cluster analysis of gene expression data revealed no distinct clustering by age in 96 PTC samples. The frequency and type of somatic mutations in the primary tumors did not differ significantly between age groups (the AYA group vs the group aged ?40 years). Six genes (extracellular matrix protein 1 [ECM1], v-erb-2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 [ERBB2], urinary plasminogen activator [UPA], 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 2 [PFKFB2], meis homeobox 2 [MEIS2], and carbonic anhydrase II [CA2]) had significant differential expression between age groups. CONCLUSIONS. The extent of disease at presentation and the survival of patients with PTC differed between AYAs and older patients. The current results indicated that these differences may be caused by several candidate genes and that these genes are expressed differentially and may play an important role in tumor cell biology. However, no distinct gene expression profiles exist for patients with PTC that distinguish between AYAs and patients aged ?40 years.","20824721","IIB","20824720","2"
"Safety and efficacy of INCB018424, a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, in myelofibrosis.","2010","BACKGROUND. Myelofibrosis is a Philadelphia chromosome–negative myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with cytopenias, splenomegaly, poor quality of life, and shortened survival. About half of patients with myelofibrosis carry a gain-of-function mutation in the Janus kinase 2 gene (JAK2 V617F) that contributes to the pathophysiology of the disease. INCB018424 is a potent and selective Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and JAK2 inhibitor. METHODS. We conducted a phase 1?2 trial of INCB018424 in patients with JAK2 V617F?positive or JAK2 V617F?negative primary myelofibrosis, post–essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis, or post–polycythemia vera myelofibrosis. RESULTS. A total of 153 patients received INCB018424 for a median duration of more than 14.7 months. The initial dose-escalation phase established 25 mg twice daily or 100 mg once daily as maximum tolerated doses, on the basis of reversible thrombocytopenia. A dose-dependent suppression of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a marker of JAK signaling, was demonstrated in patients with wild-type JAK2 and in patients with the JAK2 V617F mutation. We studied additional doses and established that a 15-mg twice-daily starting dose, followed by individualized dose titration, was the most effective and safest dosing regimen. At this dose, 17 of 33 patients (52%) had a rapid objective response (?50% reduction of splenomegaly) lasting for 12 months or more, and this therapy was associated with grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events (mainly myelosuppression) in less than 10% of patients. Patients with debilitating symptoms, including weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, and pruritus, had rapid improvement. Clinical benefits were associated with a marked diminution of levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines that are commonly elevated in myelofibrosis. CONCLUSIONS. INCB018424 was associated with marked and durable clinical benefits in patients with myelofibrosis for whom no approved therapies existed.

"Susceptibility to exacerbation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","2010","BACKGROUND. Although we know that exacerbations are key events in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), our understanding of their frequency, determinants, and effects is incomplete. In a large observational cohort, we tested the hypothesis that there is a frequent-exacerbation phenotype of COPD that is independent of disease severity. METHODS. We analyzed the frequency and associations of exacerbation in 2138 patients enrolled in the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints (ECLIPSE) study. Exacerbations were defined as events that led a care provider to prescribe antibiotics or corticosteroids (or both) or that led to hospitalization (severe exacerbations). Exacerbation frequency was observed over a period of 3 years. RESULTS. Exacerbations became more frequent (and more severe) as the severity of COPD increased; exacerbation rates in the first year of follow-up were 0.85 per person for patients with stage 2 COPD (with stage defined in accordance with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] stages), 1.34 for patients with stage 3, and 2.00 for patients with stage 4. Overall, 22% of patients with stage 2 disease, 33% with stage 3, and 47% with stage 4 had frequent exacerbations (two or more in the first year of follow-up). The single best predictor of exacerbations, across all GOLD stages, was a history of exacerbations. The frequent-exacerbation phenotype appeared to be relatively stable over a period of 3 years and could be predicted on the basis of the patient's recall of previous treated events. In addition to its association with more severe disease and prior exacerbations, the phenotype was independently associated with a history of gastroesophageal reflux or heartburn, poorer quality of life, and elevated white-cell count. CONCLUSIONS. Although exacerbations become more frequent and more severe as COPD progresses, the rate at which they occur appears to reflect an independent susceptibility phenotype. This has implications for the targeting of exacerbation-prevention strategies across the spectrum of disease severity.

"TS expression predicts postoperative recurrence in adenocarcinoma of the lung.","2011","BACKGROUND. Not all patients with lung cancer require postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy after a complete resection. However, no useful markers for either selecting appropriate candidates or for predicting clinical recurrence exist. METHODS. Tumor specimens were collected from 183 consecutive patients who underwent a complete resection for lung adenocarcinoma from 2003 to 2007 in our department. We analyzed the thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) expressions in the primary lung adenocarcinoma by immunohistochemisty. RESULTS. The strong expression of TS and DHFR was identified in 39 (21.3%) and 120 (65.6%) patients, respectively. The strong TS expression was identified in 11 (39.3%) of 28 patients and 28 (18.1%) of 155 patients in patients with and without recurrence, respectively (p=0.012). The strong DHFR expression was also identified in 23 (82.1%) and 97 (62.6%) of the patients with and without recurrence, respectively (p=0.045). Logistic regression models indicated the strong TS expression to be an independent factor for tumor recurrence. The strong TS and DHFR expression was associated with a poorer disease-free survival (DFS) according to the survival analysis. A multivariate analysis demonstrated the strong TS expression to be independently associated with an increased risk for poor DFS. CONCLUSIONS. The strong TS expression may be a useful marker for predicting postoperative recurrence in patients with lung adenocarcinoma following surgery.","20970877","VD","20970876","2"
"Association of KRAS p.G13D mutation with outcome in patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab.","2010","CONTEXT. Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have KRAS codon 12- or KRAS codon 13-mutated tumors are presently excluded from treatment with the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody cetuximab. OBJECTIVE. To test the hypothesis that KRAS codon 13 mutations are associated with a better outcome after treatment with cetuximab than observed with other KRAS mutations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS. We studied the association between KRAS mutation status (p.G13D vs other KRAS mutations) and response and survival in a pooled data set of 579 patients with chemotherapy-refractory colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab between 2001 and 2008. Patients were included in the CO.17, BOND, MABEL, EMR202600, EVEREST, BABEL, or SALVAGE clinical trials or received off-study treatment. Univariate and multivariate analyses, adjusting for possible prognostic factors and data set, were performed. The effect of the different mutations was studied in vitro by constructing isogenic cell lines with wild-type KRAS, p.G12V, or p.G13D mutant alleles and treating them with cetuximab. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES. The main efficacy end point was overall survival. Secondary efficacy end points were response rate and progression-free survival. RESULTS. In comparison with patients with other KRAS-mutated tumors, patients with p.G13D-mutated tumors (n = 32) treated with cetuximab had longer overall survival (median, 7.6 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 5.7-20.5] months vs 5.7 [95% CI, 4.9-6.8] months; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31-0.81; P = .005) and longer progression-free survival (median, 4.0 [95% CI, 1.9-6.2] months vs 1.9 [95% CI, 1.8-2.8] months; adjusted HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.32-0.81; P = .004). There was a significant interaction between KRAS mutation status (p.G13D vs other KRAS mutations) and overall survival benefit with cetuximab treatment (adjusted HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14-0.67; P = .003). In vitro and mouse model analysis showed that although p.G12V-mutated colorectal cells were insensitive to cetuximab, p.G13D-mutated cells were sensitive, as were KRAS wild-type cells. CONCLUSIONS. In this analysis, use of cetuximab was associated with longer overall and progression-free survival among patients with chemotherapy-refractory colorectal cancer with p.G13D-mutated tumors than with other KRAS-mutated tumors. Evaluation of cetuximab therapy in these tumors in prospective randomized trials may be warranted.","20978259","IB","20978259","1"
"Reduced-function CYP2C19 genotype and risk of adverse clinical outcomes among patients treated with clopidogrel predominantly for PCI: a meta-analysis.","2010","CONTENT. Clopidogrel, one of the most commonly prescribed medications, is a prodrug requiring CYP450 biotransformation. Data suggest its pharmacologic effect varies based on CYP2C19 genotype, but there is uncertainty regarding the clinical risk imparted by specific genotypes. OBJECTIVE. To define the risk of major adverse cardiovascular outcomes among carriers of 1 (? 26% prevalence in whites) and carriers of 2 (? 2% prevalence in whites) reduced-function CYP2C19 genetic variants in patients treated with clopidogrel. Data Sources and DATA EXTRACTION. Investigators from 9 studies evaluating CYP2C19 genotype and clinical outcomes in patients treated with clopidogrel contributed the relevant hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for specific cardiovascular outcomes by genotype. STUDY SELECTION. A literature search was conducted (January 2000-August 2010) in MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and EMBASE. Genetic studies were included in which clopidogrel was initiated in predominantly invasively managed patients in a manner consistent with the current guideline recommendations and in which clinical outcomes were ascertained. RESULTS. Among 9685 patients (91.3% who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and 54.5% who had an acute coronary syndrome), 863 experienced the composite end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke; and 84 patients had stent thrombosis among the 5894 evaluated for such. Overall, 71.5% were noncarriers, 26.3% had 1 reduced-function CYP2C19 allele, and 2.2% had 2 reduced-function CYP2C19 alleles. A significantly increased risk of the composite end point was evident in both carriers of 1 (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.11-2.17; P = .01) and 2 (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.24-2.50; P = .002) reduced-function CYP2C19 alleles, as compared with noncarriers. Similarly, there was a significantly increased risk of stent thrombosis in both carriers of 1 (HR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.69-4.22; P < .0001) and 2 (HR, 3.97; 95% CI, 1.75-9.02; P = .001) CYP2C19 reduced-function alleles, as compared with noncarriers. CONCLUSION. Among patients treated with clopidogrel for percutaneous coronary intervention, carriage of even 1 reduced-function CYP2C19 allele appears to be associated with a significantly increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, particularly stent thrombosis.","20978260","IB","20978259","2"
"FGFR3, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS and PIK3CA mutations in bladder cancer and their potential as biomarkers for surveillance and therapy.","2010","BACKGROUND. Fifty percent of patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MI-BC) die from their disease and current chemotherapy treatment only marginally increases survival. Novel therapies targeting receptor tyrosine kinases or activated oncogenes may improve outcome. Hence, it is necessary to stratify patients based on mutations in relevant oncogenes. Patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMI-BC) have excellent survival, however two-thirds develop recurrences. Tumor specific mutations can be used to detect recurrences in urine assays, presenting a more patient-friendly diagnostic procedure than cystoscopy. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. To address these issues, we developed a mutation assay for the simultaneous detection of 19 possible mutations in the HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS genes. With this assay and mutation assays for the FGFR3 and PIK3CA oncogenes, we screened primary bladder tumors of 257 patients and 184 recurrences from 54 patients. Additionally, in primary tumors p53 expression was obtained by immunohistochemistry. Of primary tumors 64% were mutant for FGFR3, 11% for RAS, 24% for PIK3CA, and 26% for p53. FGFR3 mutations were mutually exclusive with RAS mutations (p?=?0.001) and co-occurred with PIK3CA mutations (p?=?0.016). P53 overexpression was mutually exclusive with PIK3CA and FGFR3 mutations (p?0.029). Mutations in the RAS and PIK3CA genes were not predictors for recurrence-free, progression-free and disease-specific survival. In patients presenting with NMI-BC grade 3 and MI-BC, 33 and 36% of the primary tumors were mutant. In patients with low-grade NMI-BC, 88% of the primary tumors carried a mutation and 88% of the recurrences were mutant. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE. The mutation assays present a companion diagnostic to define patients for targeted therapies. In addition, the assays are a potential biomarker to detect recurrences during surveillance. We showed that 88% of patients presenting with low-grade NMI-BC are eligible for such a follow-up. This may contribute to a reduction in the number of cystoscopical examinations.","21072204","VD","21072204","1"
"Regulation and cytoprotective role of hexokinase III.","2010","BACKGROUND. Hexokinases (HKs) catalyze the first step in glucose metabolism. Of the three mammalian 100-kDa HK isoforms, HKI and II can bind to mitochondria and protect against cell death. HKIII does not bind mitochondria, and little is known about its regulation or cytoprotective effects. We studied the regulation of HKIII at the transcriptional and protein levels and investigated its role in cellular protection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. We show that like HKII, HKIII expression is regulated by hypoxia, but other factors that regulate HKII expression have no effect on HKIII levels. This transcriptional regulation is partially dependent on hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling. We also demonstrate regulation at the protein level, as mutations in putative N-terminal substrate binding residues altered C-terminal catalytic activity, suggesting that HKIII activity is governed, in part, by interactions between these two domains. Overexpression of HKIII reduced oxidant-induced cell death, increased ATP levels, decreased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and preserved mitochondrial membrane potential. HKIII overexpression was also associated with higher levels of transcription factors that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, and greater total mitochondrial DNA content. Attempts to target HKIII to the mitochondria by replacing its N-terminal 32-amino-acid sequence with the mitochondrial-targeting sequence of HKII led to protein aggregation, suggesting that this region is necessary to maintain proper protein folding and solubility. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE. These results suggest that HKIII is regulated by hypoxia and there are functional interactions between its two halves. Furthermore, HKIII exerts protective effects against oxidative stress, perhaps by increasing ATP levels, reducing oxidant-induced ROS production, preserving mitochondrial membrane potential, and increasing mitochondrial biogenesis.","21072205","VD","21072204","2"
"Melanomas acquire resistance to B-RAF(V600E) inhibition by RTK or N-RAS upregulation.","2010","Activating B-RAF(V600E) (also known as BRAF) kinase mutations occur in ?7% of human malignancies and ?60% of melanomas. Early clinical experience with a novel class I RAF-selective inhibitor, PLX4032, demonstrated an unprecedented 80% anti-tumour response rate among patients with B-RAF(V600E)-positive melanomas, but acquired drug resistance frequently develops after initial responses. Hypotheses for mechanisms of acquired resistance to B-RAF inhibition include secondary mutations in B-RAF(V600E), MAPK reactivation, and activation of alternative survival pathways. Here we show that acquired resistance to PLX4032 develops by mutually exclusive PDGFR? (also known as PDGFRB) upregulation or N-RAS (also known as NRAS) mutations but not through secondary mutations in B-RAF(V600E). We used PLX4032-resistant sub-lines artificially derived from B-RAF(V600E)-positive melanoma cell lines and validated key findings in PLX4032-resistant tumours and tumour-matched, short-term cultures from clinical trial patients. Induction of PDGFR? RNA, protein and tyrosine phosphorylation emerged as a dominant feature of acquired PLX4032 resistance in a subset of melanoma sub-lines, patient-derived biopsies and short-term cultures. PDGFR?-upregulated tumour cells have low activated RAS levels and, when treated with PLX4032, do not reactivate the MAPK pathway significantly. In another subset, high levels of activated N-RAS resulting from mutations lead to significant MAPK pathway reactivation upon PLX4032 treatment. Knockdown of PDGFR? or N-RAS reduced growth of the respective PLX4032-resistant subsets. Overexpression of PDGFR? or N-RAS(Q61K) conferred PLX4032 resistance to PLX4032-sensitive parental cell lines. Importantly, MAPK reactivation predicts MEK inhibitor sensitivity. Thus, melanomas escape B-RAF(V600E) targeting not through secondary B-RAF(V600E) mutations but via receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated activation of alternative survival pathway(s) or activated RAS-mediated reactivation of the MAPK pathway, suggesting additional therapeutic strategies.","21107323","VD","21107323","1"
"Calcium-dependent phospholipid scrambling by TMEM16F.","2010","In all animal cells, phospholipids are asymmetrically distributed between the outer and inner leaflets of the plasma membrane. This asymmetrical phospholipid distribution is disrupted in various biological systems. For example, when blood platelets are activated, they expose phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) to trigger the clotting system. The PtdSer exposure is believed to be mediated by Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid scramblases that transport phospholipids bidirectionally, but its molecular mechanism is still unknown. Here we show that TMEM16F (transmembrane protein 16F) is an essential component for the Ca(2+)-dependent exposure of PtdSer on the cell surface. When a mouse B-cell line, Ba/F3, was treated with a Ca(2+) ionophore under low-Ca(2+) conditions, it reversibly exposed PtdSer. Using this property, we established a Ba/F3 subline that strongly exposed PtdSer by repetitive fluorescence-activated cell sorting. A complementary DNA library was constructed from the subline, and a cDNA that caused Ba/F3 to expose PtdSer spontaneously was identified by expression cloning. The cDNA encoded a constitutively active mutant of TMEM16F, a protein with eight transmembrane segments. Wild-type TMEM16F was localized on the plasma membrane and conferred Ca(2+)-dependent scrambling of phospholipids. A patient with Scott syndrome, which results from a defect in phospholipid scrambling activity, was found to carry a mutation at a splice-acceptor site of the gene encoding TMEM16F, causing the premature termination of the protein.","21107324","VD","21107323","2"
"MEK1/2 inhibitors AS703026 and AZD6244 may be potential therapies for KRAS mutated colorectal cancer that is resistant to EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy.","2011","Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are used widely to treat metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients, but it is now clear that patients harboring K-ras mutation are resistant to EGFR mAbs such as cetuximab (Erbitux) and panitumumab (Vectibix). For this reason, current recommendations for patient care involve diagnosing the K-ras mutational status of patients prior to EGFR mAb therapy. In this study, we investigated the ability of two MEK inhibitors currently in clinical trials, AS703026 and AZD6244, to address the challenge posed by the resistance of K-ras mutated colorectal cancers to EGFR mAb. AS703026 and AZD6244 were tested in various cell-based assays and tumor xenograft studies, focusing on isogenic human colorectal tumor cell lines that expressed only WT or mutant K-Ras (D-WT or D-MUT). The EGFR mAb cetuximab inhibited the Ras-ERK pathway and proliferation of D-WT cells in vitro and in vivo, but it did not inhibit proliferation of D-MUT cells in either setting. In contrast, AS703026 and AZD6244 effectively inhibited the growth of D-MUT cells in vitro and in vivo by specific inhibition of the key MEK downstream target kinase ERK. Inhibition of MEK by AS703026 or AZD6244 also suppressed cetuximab-resistant colorectal cancer cells attributed to K-ras mutation both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings offer proof-of-concept for the use of MEK inhibitors as an effective therapy in K-ras mutated CRC.","21118963","VD","21118963","1"
"Targeting STAT3 in adoptively transferred T cells promotes their in vivo expansion and antitumor effects.","2010","Adoptive cell therapy with engineered T cells to improve natural immune response and antitumor functions has shown promise for treating cancer. However, the requirement for extensive ex vivo manipulation of T cells and the immunosuppressive effects of the tumor microenvironment limit this therapeutic modality. In the present study, we investigated the possibility to circumvent these limitations by engineering Stat3 -deficient CD8(+) T cells or by targeting Stat3 in the tumor microenvironment. We show that ablating Stat3in CD8(+) T cells prior to their transfer allows their efficient tumor infiltration and robust proliferation, resulting in increased tumor antigen-specific T-cell activity and tumor growth inhibition. For potential clinical translation, we combined adoptive T-cell therapy with a Food and Drug Administration-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib, in renal cell carcinoma and melanoma tumor models. Sunitinib inhibited Stat3 in dendritic cells and T cells and reduced conversion of transferred FoxP3(-) T cells to tumor-associated regulatory T cells while increasing transferred CD8(+) T-cell infiltration and activation at the tumor site, leading to inhibition of primary tumor growth. These data show that adoptively transferred T cells can be expanded and activated in vivo either by engineering Stat3-silenced T cells or by targeting Stat3 systemically with small-molecule inhibitors.","21118964","VD","21118963","2"
"JAK2 V617F mutation in myelodysplastic syndrome, myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable, refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts with thrombocytosis, and acute myeloid leukemia.","2010","BACKGROUND. The JAK2 V617F mutation has been noted in the cases of polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis patients. This mutation occurs less frequently in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other hematologic diseases, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); myelodysplatic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-U); and refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts with thrombocytosis (RARS-T). METHODS. Patients diagnosed with hematologic diseases other than MPN who visited Seoul St Mary's Hospital from January 2007 to February 2010 were selected. A total of 43 patients were enrolled in this study: 12 MDS, 9 MDS/MPN-U, 7 RARS-T, and 15 AML patients. The diseases were diagnosed according to the 2008 WHO classification criteria. Data obtained from JAK2 V617F mutation analysis and cytogenetic study as well as complete blood count and clinical data were analyzed. RESULTS. Of the 43 patients, 6 (13.9%) harbored the JAK2 V617F mutation. The incidence of the JAK2 V617F mutation in each patient group was as follows: 8.3% (1/12), MDS; 22.2% (2/9), MDS/MPN-U; 14.3% (1/7), RARS-T; and 13.3%, (2/15) AML. The platelet count was higher than 450×10(9)/L in 3 of the 6 patients (50%) harboring the JAK2 V617F mutation, and it was in the normal range in the remaining 3 patients. Among the 6 patients, 1 MDS and 1 MDS/MPN-U patients had the 46,XX,del(20)(q11.2) karyotype. CONCLUSION. The JAK2 V617F mutation is associated with an increased platelet count in MDS, MDS/MPN-U, RARS-T, and AML patients. Cytogenetic abnormalities of del(20)(q11.2) occurred in 1/3 of patients with the JAK2 V617F mutation but further studies are required to confirm this association.","21120162","IVD","21120162","1"
"Biological effects of fucoidan isolated from Fucus vesiculosus on thrombosis and vascular cells.","2010","BACKGROUND. Fucoidan is a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan, which has a molecular structure similar to that of heparin. The antithrombotic effects of fucoidan in vitro have been widely reported, but its antithrombotic effects in vivo as well as its other biological properties in vitro have not been well investigated. METHODS. This study investigated the effects and mechanism of fucoidan from Fucus vesiculosus on thrombosis both in vitro and in vivo. A ferric chloride-induced mouse carotid artery thrombosis model was used to determine the antithrombotic effects of fucoidan in vivo. Additionally, changes in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were examined in vascular cells treated with fucoidan. RESULTS. In vivo studies employing a ferric chloride-induced mouse carotid artery thrombosis model indicated that fucoidan had a stronger antithrombotic activity than heparin. Further, vascular cells treated with fucoidan demonstrated a decrease in proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production as well as inhibition of proliferation. CONCLUSION. The major findings of this study showed that fucoidan has a stronger antithrombotic effect than heparin in vivo and that fucoidan has an inhibitory effect on proinflammatory cytokine production and proliferation of vascular cells.","21120163","IVD","21120162","2"
"Acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in EGFR-mutant lung cancer: distinct natural history of patients with tumors harboring the T790M mutation.","2011","PURPOSE. Patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant lung adenocarcinoma develop acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) after a median of 10 to 16 months. In half of these cases, a second EGFR mutation, T790M, underlies acquired resistance. We undertook this study to examine the clinical course of patients harboring the T790M mutation following progression on TKI. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs were identified as part of a prospective rebiopsy protocol in which postprogression tumor specimens were collected for molecular analysis. Postprogression survival and characteristics of disease progression were compared in patients with and without T790M. RESULTS. We identified T790M in the initial rebiopsy specimens from 58 of 93 patients (62%, 95% CI: 52-72). T790M was more common in biopsies of lung/pleura tissue and lymph nodes than in more distant sites (P = 0.014). Median postprogression survival was 16 months (interquartile range = 9-29 months); patients with T790M had a significantly longer postprogression survival (P = 0.036). Patients without T790M more often progressed in a previously uninvolved organ system (P = 0.014) and exhibited a poorer performance status at time of progression (P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS. Among patients with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs, the presence of T790M defines a clinical subset with a relatively favorable prognosis and more indolent progression. Knowledge of T790M status is therefore important both for the clinical care of these patients and for the optimal design and interpretation of clinical trials in this setting.","21135146","IA","21135146","1"
"Gene expression profile correlates with T-cell infiltration and relative survival in glioblastoma patients vaccinated with dendritic cell immunotherapy.","2011","PURPOSE. To assess the feasibility, safety, and toxicity of autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell (DC) vaccination and toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists in patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma. Clinical and immune responses were monitored and correlated with tumor gene expression profiles. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. Twenty-three patients with glioblastoma (WHO grade IV) were enrolled in this dose-escalation study and received three biweekly injections of glioma lysate-pulsed DCs followed by booster vaccinations with either imiquimod or poly-ICLC adjuvant every 3 months until tumor progression. Gene expression profiling, immunohistochemistry, FACS, and cytokine bead arrays were performed on patient tumors and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS. DC vaccinations are safe and not associated with any dose-limiting toxicity. The median overall survival from the time of initial surgical diagnosis of glioblastoma was 31.4 months, with a 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rate of 91%, 55%, and 47%, respectively. Patients whose tumors had mesenchymal gene expression signatures exhibited increased survival following DC vaccination compared with historic controls of the same genetic subtype. Tumor samples with a mesenchymal gene expression signature had a higher number of CD3(+) and CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes compared with glioblastomas of other gene expression signatures (P = 0.006). CONCLUSION. Autologous tumor lysate-pulsed DC vaccination in conjunction with TLR agonists is safe as adjuvant therapy in newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma patients. Our results suggest that the mesenchymal gene expression profile may identify an immunogenic subgroup of glioblastoma that may be more responsive to immune-based therapies.","21135147","IA","21135146","2"

Gefitinib and erlotinib were shown to be particularly effective in a clinically selected subpopulation of non-small cell lung cancer patients (NSCLC): adenocarcinoma histology, non-smoking status, Asian origin and female gender have been associated with improved clinical benefit compared to the unselected NSCLC population. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic and predictive role of EGFR and KRAS analysis in advanced lung adenocarcinomas, selected according to clinical features associated to better response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), namely female gender and non-smoker or former light smoker status.

"Prognostic and predictive implications of EGFR mutations, EGFR copy number and KRAS mutations in advanced stage lung adenocarcinoma.","2010","BACKGROUND/AIM. Gefitinib and erlotinib were shown to be particularly effective in a clinically selected subpopulation of non-small cell lung cancer patients (NSCLC): adenocarcinoma histology, non-smoking status, Asian origin and female gender have been associated with improved clinical benefit compared to the unselected NSCLC population. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic and predictive role of EGFR and KRAS analysis in advanced lung adenocarcinomas, selected according to clinical features associated to better response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), namely female gender and non-smoker or former light smoker status.

"Safety and efficacy of TG101348, a selective JAK2 inhibitor, in myelofibrosis.","2011","PURPOSE. Myelofibrosis is a myeloid malignancy associated with anemia, splenomegaly, and constitutional symptoms. Patients frequently harbor JAK-STAT activating mutations that are sensitive to TG101348, a selective small-molecule Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor. PATIENTS AND METHODS. In a multicenter phase I trial, oral TG101348 was administered once a day to patients with high- or intermediate-risk primary or post-polycythemia vera/essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis. Results: Fifty-nine patients were treated, including 28 in the dose-escalation phase. The maximum-tolerated dose was 680 mg/d, and dose-limiting toxicity was a reversible and asymptomatic increase in the serum amylase level. Forty-three patients (73%) continued treatment beyond six cycles; the median cumulative exposure to TG101348 was 380 days. Adverse events included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anemia, and thrombocytopenia; corresponding grades 3 to 4 incidence rates were 3%, 3%, 10%, 35%, and 24%. TG101348 treatment had modest effect on serum cytokine levels, but greater than half of the patients with early satiety, night sweats, fatigue, pruritus, and cough achieved rapid and durable improvement in these symptoms. By six and 12 cycles of treatment, 39% and 47% of patients, respectively, had achieved a spleen response per International Working Group criteria. The majority of patients with leukocytosis or thrombocytosis at baseline (n = 28 and n = 10, respectively) achieved normalization of blood counts after six (57% and 90%, respectively) and 12 (56% and 88%, respectively) cycles. A significant decrease in JAK2 V617F allele burden was observed at 6 months in mutation-positive patients (n = 51; P = .04), particularly in the subgroup with allele burden greater than 20% (n = 23; P < .01); the decrease was durable at 12 months. CONCLUSION. TG101348 is well tolerated and produces significant reduction in disease burden and durable clinical benefit in patients with myelofibrosis.","21220608","IA","21220608","1"
"Molecular genetics of adult acute myeloid leukemia: prognostic and therapeutic implications.","2011","Molecular analyses of leukemic blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have revealed a striking heterogeneity with regard to the presence of acquired gene mutations and changes in gene and microRNA expression. Multiple submicroscopic genetic alterations with prognostic significance have been discovered. Application of gene- and microRNA profiling has identified genome-wide expression signatures that separate cytogenetic and molecular subsets of patients with AML into previously unrecognized biologic and/or prognostic subgroups. These and similar future findings are likely to have a major impact on the clinical management of AML because many of the identified genetic alterations not only represent independent prognosticators, but also may constitute targets for specific therapeutic intervention. In this report, we review genetic findings in AML and discuss their clinical implications.","21220609","IA","21220608","2"
"GSK1120212 (JTP-74057) is an inhibitor of MEK activity and activation with favorable pharmacokinetic properties for sustained in vivo pathway inhibition.","2011","PURPOSE. Despite their preclinical promise, previous MEK inhibitors have shown little benefit for patients. This likely reflects the narrow therapeutic window for MEK inhibitors due to the essential role of the P42/44 MAPK pathway in many nontumor tissues. GSK1120212 is a potent and selective allosteric inhibitor of the MEK1 and MEK2 (MEK1/2) enzymes with promising antitumor activity in a phase I clinical trial (ASCO 2010). Our studies characterize GSK1120212' enzymatic, cellular, and in vivo activities, describing its unusually long circulating half-life. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. Enzymatic studies were conducted to determine GSK1120212 inhibition of recombinant MEK, following or preceding RAF kinase activation. Cellular studies examined GSK1120212 inhibition of ERK1 and 2 phosphorylation (p-ERK1/2) as well as MEK1/2 phosphorylation and activation. Further studies explored the sensitivity of cancer cell lines, and drug pharmacokinetics and efficacy in multiple tumor xenograft models. RESULTS. In enzymatic and cellular studies, GSK1120212 inhibits MEK1/2 kinase activity and prevents Raf-dependent MEK phosphorylation (S217 for MEK1), producing prolonged p-ERK1/2 inhibition. Potent cell growth inhibition was evident in most tumor lines with mutant BRAF or Ras. In xenografted tumor models, GSK1120212 orally dosed once daily had a long circulating half-life and sustained suppression of p-ERK1/2 for more than 24 hours; GSK1120212 also reduced tumor Ki67, increased p27(Kip1/CDKN1B), and caused tumor growth inhibition in multiple tumor models. The largest antitumor effect was among tumors harboring mutant BRAF or Ras. CONCLUSIONS. GSK1120212 combines high potency, selectivity, and long circulating half-life, offering promise for successfully targeting the narrow therapeutic window anticipated for clinical MEK inhibitors.","21245089","VD","21245089","1"
"Imaging colon cancer response following treatment with AZD1152: a preclinical analysis of [18F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose and 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine imaging.","2011","PURPOSE. To determine whether treatment response to the Aurora B kinase inhibitor, AZD1152, could be monitored early in the course of therapy by noninvasive [(18)F]-labeled fluoro-2-deoxyglucose, [(18)F]FDG, and/or 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine, [(18)F]FLT, PET imaging. Experimental design: AZD1152-treated and control HCT116 and SW620 xenograft-bearing animals were monitored for tumor size and by [(18)F]FDG, and [(18)F]FLT PET imaging. Additional studies assessed the endogenous and exogenous contributions of thymidine synthesis in the two cell lines. RESULTS. Both xenografts showed a significant volume-reduction to AZD1152. In contrast, [(18)F]FDG uptake did not demonstrate a treatment response. [(18)F]FLT uptake decreased to less than 20% of control values in AZD1152-treated HCT116 xenografts, whereas [(18)F]FLT uptake was near background levels in both treated and untreated SW620 xenografts. The EC(50) for AZD1152-HQPA was approximately 10 nmol/L in both SW620 and HCT116 cells; in contrast, SW620 cells were much more sensitive to methotrexate (MTX) and 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) than HCT116 cells. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated marginally lower expression of thymidine kinase in SW620 compared with HCT116 cells. The aforementioned results suggest that SW620 xenografts have a higher dependency on the de novo pathway of thymidine utilization than HCT116 xenografts. CONCLUSIONS. AZD1152 treatment showed antitumor efficacy in both colon cancer xenografts. Although [(18)F]FDG PET was inadequate in monitoring treatment response, [(18)F]FLT PET was very effective in monitoring response in HCT116 xenografts, but not in SW620 xenografts. These observations suggest that de novo thymidine synthesis could be a limitation and confounding factor for [(18)F]FLT PET imaging and quantification of tumor proliferation, and this may apply to some clinical studies as well.","21245090","VD","21245089","2"
"KIT mutations in ocular melanoma: frequency and anatomic distribution.","2011","KIT mutations are known to occur in ~15% of chronic sun damaged cutaneous, mucosal, and acral melanomas. Melanomas with demonstrated activating mutations in KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA) may benefit from treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Currently, the limited data regarding KIT mutational status in ocular melanoma suggest that activating mutations are extremely rare. PDGFRA mutational status in ocular melanoma has not been determined. Seventy-five ocular melanomas (53 choroidal, 6 iris, 11 ciliary body, and 5 conjuctival) were selected from the files of the Department of Ophthalmology. High-resolution melting curve analysis and sequencing were performed to detect mutations in KIT exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 and PDGFRA exons 12 and 18. Results of mutational analysis were correlated with anatomical site and KIT (CD117) immunohistochemistry. Eight of 75 (11%) ocular melanomas contained mutations in either the KIT or PDGFRA gene. Five of 53 (9%) choroidal melanomas were associated with mutations (KIT exon 11=3; KIT exon 17=1; PDGFRA intron 18=1). Two of six (33%) iris melanomas and a single (9%) ciliary body melanoma harbored KIT exon 11 mutations. No mutations were identified in conjunctival melanomas. The distribution of KIT and PDGFRA mutations by ocular melanoma anatomical site did not reach statistical significance (P=0.393) CD117 positivity was not predictive of KIT mutational status as only 6 of 58 (10%) CD177-positive tumors harbored KIT mutations. In addition, a KIT exon 17 mutation was identified in one CD117-negative tumor. KIT and PDGFRA mutations do occur in ocular melanomas at a frequency (11%) that is similar to acral and mucosal melanomas. Limited correlation of CD117 positivity with mutational status suggests that all ocular melanomas should undergo mutational analysis to determine if imatinib therapy is appropriate.","21478825","IVD","21478825","1"
"Gene amplification and protein overexpression of MET are common events in ovarian clear-cell adenocarcinoma: their roles in tumor progression and prognostication of the patient.","2011","The aim of this study was to assess protein overexpression and gene copy number alterations of MET in ovarian clear-cell adenocarcinoma, and to assess its potential as a novel therapeutic target. Ninety cases of clear-cell adenocarcinoma were analyzed for MET protein overexpression and copy number alterations of the MET gene by immunohistochemistry and brightfield double in situ hybridization, respectively. In addition, 101 cases of the non-clear-cell type ovarian carcinomas at advanced stages were also evaluated for comparison. MET overexpression was assigned when complete membrane staining with moderate or strong intensity was observed in at least 10% of the tumor cells examined. Double in situ hybridization was determined as positive when the tumor exhibited high-level polysomy (?4 copies in ?40% of tumor cells) or MET gene amplification. MET overexpression was detected in 20 of 90 clear-cell adenocarcinomas (22%) and none of 111 non-clear-cell type ovarian carcinomas. Double in situ hybridization was positive in 21 of 89 informative clear-cell adenocarcinomas (24%) and only 3 non-clear-cell type ovarian carcinomas (3%). In the whole population, true amplification of the MET gene was detected only in the clear-cell adenocarcinoma histology (five cases, 6%). In clear-cell adenocarcinomas, double in situ hybridization positivity was highly correlated with the presence of MET overexpression and a poorly differentiated histology of tumors (P=0.0105 and 0.00038, respectively). For the patients with clear-cell adenocarcinomas, MET overexpression, as well as advanced clinical stage and the poorly differentiated histology of tumors, was identified as an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival. In conclusion, among ovarian carcinomas, the amplification of the MET proto-oncogene is highly selective and commonly occurs in clear-cell adenocarcinoma. MET could serve as a biomarker for the prognostication of patients with clear-cell adenocarcinoma and tumor progression, and has potential as a novel therapeutic target for this carcinoma.","21478826","IVD","21478825","2"
"Clinical characteristics of patients with lung adenocarcinomas harboring BRAF mutations.","2011","PURPOSE. BRAF mutations occur in non-small-cell lung cancer. Therapies targeting BRAF mutant tumors have recently been identified. We undertook this study to determine the clinical characteristics of patients with lung adenocarcinomas harboring BRAF mutations. PATIENTS AND METHODS. We reviewed data from consecutive patients with lung adenocarcinoma whose tumors underwent BRAF, EGFR, and KRAS mutation testing as well as fluorescence in situ hybridization for ALK rearrangements. Patient characteristics including age, sex, race, performance status, smoking history, stage, treatment history, and overall survival were collected. RESULTS. Among 697 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, BRAF mutations were present in 18 patients (3%; 95% CI, 2% to 4%). The BRAF mutations identified were V600E (50%), G469A (39%), and D594G (11%). Mutations in EGFR were present in 24%, KRAS in 25%, and ALK translocations in 6%. In contrast to patients with EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements who were mostly never smokers, all patients with BRAF mutations were current or former smokers (P < .001). The median overall survival of advanced-stage patients with BRAF mutations was not reached. In comparison, the median overall survival of patients with EGFR mutations was 37 months (P = .73), with KRAS mutations was 18 months (P = .12), and with ALK rearrangements was not reached (P = .64). CONCLUSION. BRAF mutations occur in 3% of patients with lung adenocarcinoma and occur more commonly in current and former smokers. The incidence of BRAF mutations other than V600E is significantly higher in lung cancer than in melanoma.","21483012","IVD","21483012","1"

"RAS mutations in cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors.","2012","BACKGROUND. Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas are common findings in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors. METHODS. We performed a molecular analysis to identify oncogenic mutations (HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, CDKN2A, and TP53) in the lesions from patients treated with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. An analysis of an independent validation set and functional studies with BRAF inhibitors in the presence of the prevalent RAS mutation was also performed. RESULTS. Among 21 tumor samples, 13 had RAS mutations (12 in HRAS). In a validation set of 14 samples, 8 had RAS mutations (4 in HRAS). Thus, 60% (21 of 35) of the specimens harbored RAS mutations, the most prevalent being HRAS Q61L. Increased proliferation of HRAS Q61L-mutant cell lines exposed to vemurafenib was associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-pathway signaling and activation of ERK-mediated transcription. In a mouse model of HRAS Q61L-mediated skin carcinogenesis, the vemurafenib analogue PLX4720 was not an initiator or a promoter of carcinogenesis but accelerated growth of the lesions harboring HRAS mutations, and this growth was blocked by concomitant treatment with a MEK inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS. Mutations in RAS, particularly HRAS, are frequent in cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas that develop in patients treated with vemurafenib. The molecular mechanism is consistent with the paradoxical activation of MAPK signaling and leads to accelerated growth of these lesions.

"Preliminary study of two antiviral agents for hepatitis C genotype 1.","2012","BACKGROUND. Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who have not had a response to therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin may benefit from the addition of multiple direct-acting antiviral agents to their treatment regimen. METHODS. This open-label, phase 2a study included an exploratory cohort of 21 patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection who had not had a response to previous therapy (i.e., had not had ?2 log(10) decline in HCV RNA after ?12 weeks of treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin). We randomly assigned patients to receive the NS5A replication complex inhibitor daclatasvir (60 mg once daily) and the NS3 protease inhibitor asunaprevir (600 mg twice daily) alone (group A, 11 patients) or in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin (group B, 10 patients) for 24 weeks. The primary end point was the percentage of patients with a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the end of the treatment period. RESULTS. A total of 4 patients in group A (36%; 2 of 9 with HCV genotype 1a and 2 of 2 with genotype 1b) had a sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after treatment and also at 24 weeks after treatment.. Six patients (all with HCV genotype 1a) had viral breakthrough while receiving therapy, and resistance mutations to both antiviral agents were found in all cases; 1 patient had a viral response at the end of treatment but had a relapse after the treatment period. All 10 patients in group B had a sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after treatment, and 9 had a sustained virologic response at 24 weeks after treatment. Diarrhea was the most common adverse event in both groups. Six patients had transient elevations of alanine aminotransferase levels to more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range. CONCLUSIONS. This preliminary study involving patients with HCV genotype 1 infection who had not had a response to prior therapy showed that a sustained virologic response can be achieved with two direct-acting antiviral agents only. In addition, a high rate of sustained virologic response was achieved when the two direct-acting antiviral agents were combined with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin.

"Mutations in the RET protooncogene in sporadic pheochromocytomas.","1995","Mutations in the RET protooncogene have recently been demonstrated in families with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 2A and 2B. We have studied pheochromocytomas from 29 individuals who had no clinical evidence of MEN-2A or -2B to determine the frequency of germline and/or somatic mutations in exons 10, 11, and 16 of the RET protooncogene. Of the 29 tumors examined, 3 (10%) were found to have a mutation in 1 of the 3 exons. These mutations were not found in the DNA from the peripheral blood from these individuals, indicating that the mutations in the tumors were somatic in origin. Although we cannot exclude the possibility of mutations in other regions of the RET protooncogene, our data suggest that 1) individuals presenting with apparently sporadic pheochromocytomas are not likely to have undiagnosed MEN-2A or -2B; and 2) somatic mutations in exons 10, 11, and 16 in the RET protooncogene contribute to the process of tumorigenesis in a small percentage of sporadic pheochromocytomas.","7852530","IVD","7852530","1"
"The validity of estimating total body fat and fat-free mass from skinfold thickness in adults with growth hormone deficiency.","1995","The regression equations of Durnin and Womersley for estimating total body fat (TBF) and fat-free mass (FFM) from skinfold thickness were validated for adult GH-deficient (GHD) patients by comparing the values of TBF and FFM from the prediction equations with the directly measured values from dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Twenty-seven male and 24 female patients (aged 21-61 yr) were studied. GHD was isolated in 5 cases and was part of a spectrum of hypopituitarism due to a variety of causes in 46 cases. The mean period of GHD was 6.9 +/- 4.6 yr. All patients were receiving stable replacement therapy. The validation statistics showed no significant differences (P > 0.05) between measured and predicted values of TBF and FFM in either males (24.5 vs. 24.9 and 65.5 vs. 65.8 kg) or females (24.6 vs. 26.3 and 44.7 vs. 43.9 kg). Mean differences were smaller in males (0.4 and 0.2 kg) than females (1.7 and -0.8 kg); they were less than 1% in males and less than 2% in females. Therefore, the Durnin and Womersley equations are suitable for general use with GHD patients. Using TBF (kilograms) from dual energy x-ray absorptiometry as the dependent variable and the log of the sum of skinfold thickness as the independent variable, linear regression equations were formulated to predict TBF in GHD patients. The lowest SE of estimate was 3.8 kg in males and 4.6 kg in females. To determine their general applicability, these equations will need to be cross-validated.","7852531","IVD","7852530","2"
"A mutation in the RET proto-oncogene associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B and sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma.","1994","Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) comprises three clinically distinct, dominantly inherited cancer syndromes. MEN 2A patients develop medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and phaeochromocytoma. MEN 2B patients show in addition ganglioneuromas of the gastrointestinal tract and skeletal abnormalities. In familial MTC, only the thyroid is affected. Germ-line mutations of the RET proto-oncogene have recently been reported in association with MEN 2A and familial MTC. All mutations occurred within codons specifying cysteine residues in the transition point between the RET protein extracellular and transmembrane domains. We now show that MEN 2B is also associated with mutation of the RET proto-oncogene. A mutation in codon 664, causing the substitution of a threonine for a methionine in the tyrosine kinase domain of the protein, was found in all nine unrelated MEN 2B patients studied.

"Actions of alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents on two types of intracellular calcium stores mobilized by noradrenaline in rat aorta.","1993","In isolated rat aortic strips noradrenaline induces a biphasic contractile response in Ca-free medium, associated with two different intracellular calcium pools, one of which is common to caffeine. We analyzed the mechanisms involved in the depletion and repletion of both intracellular Ca pools sensitive to noradrenaline in different experimental procedures in presence of prazosin, phentolamine and yohimbine. At 37 degrees C the alpha-adrenergic blocking agents inhibited contractile responses to noradrenaline in Ca-free medium, with prazosin being highly selective. alpha 2-adrenoceptors probably do not participate in the release of Ca from internal stores, as no contractile response was observed after addition of clonidine in Ca-free medium. This indicates that noradrenaline-induced Ca-release from internal stores is mainly due to activation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors. At 25 degrees C, these compounds failed to inhibit caffeine-induced contraction in Ca-free medium, but abolished the release of Ca from an intracellular store only sensitive to noradrenaline. This effect is attributable to a blockade of alpha 1-adrenoceptors and/or inhibition of receptor-mediated signal transduction.","7906867","IIC","7906866","2"

Our data show a strong correlation between disease phenotype and the nature and position of the RET mutation, suggesting that a simple, constitutive activation of the RET tyrosine kinase is unlikely to explain the events leading to MEN 2A and FMTC.","7907913","IIC","7907913","1"
"Potential biological targets for anti-Alzheimer drugs.","1993 Nov-Dec","The stunning accumulation of data on the physiopathology of Alzheimer's disease is a real hinderance to pharmacologists who have to make decisions as to what molecules should be assessed first in man. Considering the cumbersomeness and cost of clinical trials in that field, a review of potential targets for drugs that are supposed to be active against the disease has become necessary, for a true definition of the rational justifications of trials to be envisaged.","7907916","IIC","7907913","2"
"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. Clinical features and screening.","1994","Prospective screening programs have changed the presenting clinical features of MEN 2, the association of medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and parathyroid disease. Currently, all manifestations of MEN 2 syndrome can be diagnosed at an early stage. Gene carrier status can be identified by characterization of specific mutations. Prospective screening for early medullary thyroid carcinoma by calcitonin testing and for pheochromocytoma by several techniques routinely permits identification of early manifestations.","7913021","IIC","7913021","1"
"Management of individual tumor syndromes. Medullary thyroid carcinoma and hyperparathyroidism.","1994","Significant advances have been made in the understanding of the pathophysiology and the ability to effectively screen for and treat medullary thyroid carcinoma. The parafollicular cells, or C-cells, are the cell of origin for medullary thyroid carcinoma. C-cell hyperplasia is a premalignant disease that progresses rapidly to medullary thyroid carcinoma. C-cells produce calcitonin, which serves as a marker to prospectively screen patients for C-cell disease. One major concern in screening for this disease has been the incidence of false positive results. This problem is addressed in light of new, more stringent criteria for the diagnosis of C-cell hyperplasia. The association of hyperparathyroidism with MEN 2 is discussed with evidence that thyroidectomy of C-cell disease may affect the incidence of parathyroid disease.","7913022","IIC","7913021","2"
"Ras mutations in human melanoma: a marker of malignant progression.","1994","In this study we address whether there is an association between ras mutations and disease progression in malignant melanoma. DNA was extracted from 100 paraffin-embedded melanomas and sequences around the 12th, 13th and 61st codons of N-, H-, and K-ras were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction and probed for single base pair mutations using synthetic oligonucleotide probes. Thirty-six melanomas contained mutations, which in 25 cases (69%) occurred at the 61st codon of N-ras. The results from dot blot hybridizations were confirmed by subcloning and sequencing the polymerase chain reaction products from two tumors. No ras mutations were found in Clark's level I melanomas, whereas 19% of level II and 45% of the more advanced primary tumors contained ras mutations (Chi squared test: p < 0.05). The median Breslow thickness of primary melanomas with ras mutations was 0.72 mm, significantly thicker than the 0.42 mm of melanomas without mutations (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.042). Ras mutations were found more frequently in primary tumors from continuously exposed skin (56%) than tumors from intermittently or non-sun exposed sites (21%). Fifty percent of locally recurrent and 47% of metastatic melanomas had ras mutations. We conclude that ras mutations occur in a subset of melanomas from sun-exposed skin as a feature of tumor progression.","8120410","VD","8120410","1"
"Ultraviolet irradiation induces c-fos but not c-Ha-ras proto-oncogene expression in human epidermis.","1994","The link between sun exposure and skin cancer is well established, but the mechanism of photocarcinogenesis is still incompletely understood. In vitro experimentation has shown that induction of the c-fos proto-oncogene occurs in cultured human keratinocytes after ultraviolet exposure, and c-Ha-ras mutations are commonly present in human skin neoplasms removed from chronically sun-exposed sites. In the present study, the effect of UV irradiation on the expression of these two proto-oncogenes was examined. The sun-protected volar forearm of six subjects was exposed to a standardized erythemogenic dose of solar-simulated light, and punch biopsies were obtained after 1 h and 24 h from the irradiated area and a nearby shielded area. Expression of c-fos, determined by in situ hybridization of histologic cross-sections, was detected in the basal and lower epidermal layers in all biopsies. However, at 1 h there was a marked increase that returned to baseline by 24 h. c-Ha-ras mRNA could not be detected by riboprobe hybridization in any of the biopsy specimens. Our data demonstrate transient induction of c-fos but not c-Ha-ras expression, at least at the timepoints studied, following a modest UV exposure in normal skin. This phenomenon may lead to the subsequent constitutive over-expression and super-inducibility of c-fos observed in cultured keratinocytes derived from photodamaged skin and may facilitate the development of skin cancer.","8120411","VD","8120410","2"
"Prognostic impact of mutated K-ras gene in surgically resected non-small cell lung cancer patients.","1993","Mutated K-ras oncogenes have been detected in a third of lung adenocarcinomas, located usually in codon 12, its presence correlating negatively with survival. To further define the role of K-ras point mutations in non-small cell lung cancer, we studied the presence of mutated K-ras genes in surgical specimens from 66 patients. Polymerase chain reaction was performed from sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. We screened for point mutations in codons 12, 13 and 61 of the K-ras gene by dot blot hybridization analysis with mutation-specific oligonucleotide probes. Ras gene mutations were present in 13 of 66 carcinomas (20%), nine in codon 12 and four in codon 61. Three squamous cell carcinomas harbored two different point mutations in K-ras codon 12. Mutated K-ras genes were found more frequently in squamous cell carcinomas (eight of 38) than in adenocarcinoma (three of 22). Analysis of nucleotide sequence disclosed a multifarious mutation pattern of K-ras codon 12, where the most common conversion was from glycine (GGT) to valine (GTT). K-ras point mutation positive subset had poorer survival, nine of the 13 patients died during the follow-up period as compared with 22 of 53 patients with no mutation in the K-ras gene (P = 0.01). The difference was also strikingly significant when stratified according to node status.","8395679","IVD","8395679","1"
"Butyrolactone I, a selective inhibitor of cdk2 and cdc2 kinase.","1993","We screened cdc2 kinase inhibitors from cultured mediums of micro organisms using purified mouse cyclin B-cdc2 kinase and a specific substrate peptide for cdc2 kinase. A selective inhibitor of cdc2 kinase was isolated from the cultured medium of Aspergillus species F-25799, and identified as butyrolactone I. Butyrolactone I inhibited cdc2 and cdk2 kinases but it had little effect on mitogen-activated protein kinase, protein kinase C, cyclic-AMP dependent kinase, casein kinase II, casein kinase I or epidermal growth factor-receptor tyrosine kinase. Its inhibitory effect was found to be due to competition with ATP. Butyrolactone I selectively inhibited the H1 histone phosphorylation in nuclear extracts. It also inhibited the phosphorylation of the product of retinoblastoma susceptibility gene in nuclear extracts and intact cells. Thus butyrolactone I should be very useful for elucidating the function of cdc2 and cdk2 kinases in cell cycle regulation.","8395680","IVD","8395679","2"

"Germline and somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET proto-oncogene in papillary renal carcinomas.","1997","Hereditary papillary renal carcinoma (HPRC) is a recently recognized form of inherited kidney cancer characterized by a predisposition to develop multiple, bilateral papillary renal tumours. The pattern of inheritance of HPRC is consistent with autosomal dominant transmission with reduced penetrance. HPRC is histologically and genetically distinct from two other causes of inherited renal carcinoma, von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) and the chromosome translocation (3;8). Malignant papillary renal carcinomas are characterized by trisomy of chromosomes 7, 16 and 17, and in men, by loss of the Y chromosome. Inherited and sporadic clear cell renal carcinomas are characterized by inactivation of both copies of the VHL gene by mutation, and/or by hypermethylation. We found that the HPRC gene was located at chromosome 7q31.1-34 in a 27-centimorgan (cM) interval between D7S496 and D7S1837. We identified missense mutations located in the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET gene in the germline of affected members of HPRC families and in a subset of sporadic papillary renal carcinomas. Three mutations in the MET gene are located in codons that are homologous to those in c-kit and RET, proto-oncogenes that are targets of naturally-occurring mutations. The results suggest that missense mutations located in the MET proto-oncogene lead to constitutive activation of the MET protein and papillary renal carcinomas.","9140397","IVD","9140397","1"
"Chemotherapy induces transient sex chromosomal and autosomal aneuploidy in human sperm.","1997","Each year more than 20,000 children and young persons of reproductive age are exposed to known mutagens in the form of chemo- and/or radiotherapy for cancer in the States. As more of these treatments are effective there is growing concern that genetic defects are introduced in the germ cells of these young patients. It is well documented for male rodents that treatment with chemo- and radio-therapeutic agents before mating can cause genetic damage in the germ line, and the magnitude of heritable effects depends on the spermatogenic cell stage treated. Similar germinal effects are suspected to occur in humans but remain unproven. Hodgkin's disease (HD) is an example of a malignancy which is typically diagnosed during a patient's reproductive years. In our study we observed eight male HD patients who were treated with NOVP (Novanthrone, Oncovin, Vinblastine, Prednisone) chemotherapy. We evaluated sperm aneuploidy using multi-colour fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and found approximately 5-fold increases in sperm with disomies, diploidies and complex genotypes involving chromosome X, Y and 8. Increases in sex chromosome aneuploidies arose from segregation errors at meiosis I as well as meiosis II. The aneuploidy effects were transient, however, declining to pretreatment levels within approximately 100 days after the end of the therapy. When compared with normal men, some HD patients showed higher proportions of certain sperm aneuploidy types even before their first therapy.","9140398","IVD","9140397","2"
"Somatic in frame deletions not involving juxtamembranous cysteine residues strongly activate the RET proto-oncogene.","1997","Somatic RET mutations have been identified in a variable proportion (about 30-70%) of sporadic Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC) cases. They are represented by the Met918Thr substitution (exon 16) typical of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B) and, to a lesser extent, by nucleotide changes occurring at one of five critical cysteine residues (exons 10 and 11) typical of MEN type 2A (MEN2A). An in vitro transforming activity has already been demonstrated for these mutations. A few different MTC somatic mutations have been reported so far whose biological activity has still to be tested. In this paper we report the identification, in two MTC tumor samples, of two interstitial deletions of 48 bp and 6 bp occurred in exons 10 and 11 respectively. Both were somatic heterozygous in frame mutations, not involving any cysteine residue. Moreover, the expression of a full length RET cDNA carrying one of the two deletions demonstrated a strong transforming capacity in NIH3T3 cells.","9191060","IVD","9191060","1"
"Apparent protection from instability of repeat sequences in cancer-related genes in replication error positive gastrointestinal cancers.","1997","Genomic instability at simple repeated sequences has been observed in various types of human cancers and is considered an important mechanism in tumorigenesis. Alterations at microsatellite loci have been reported scattered throughout the genome. Recently, the transforming growth factor-beta receptor type II (TGF-beta RII) and the insulin-like growth factor II receptor (IGF-IIR) genes were shown to have inactivating mutations within coding microsatellite sequences. The demonstration of mutations in two growth regulatory genes supports the idea that other regulatory genes with repeat sequences may also be targets in tumours with defective mismatch repair. We examined genes involved in tumour suppression, cell adhesion and cell cycle regulation for mutations at small repeat sequences in replication error positive gastrointestinal cancers. Several polymorphisms were found which exhibited instability, but no other instability was present in the regions examined.","9191061","IVD","9191060","2"
"Activating and dominant inactivating c-KIT catalytic domain mutations in distinct clinical forms of human mastocytosis.","1999","Human mastocytosis is characterized by increased mast cells. It usually occurs as a sporadic disease that is often transient and limited in children and persistent or progressive in adults. The c-KIT protooncogene encodes KIT, a tyrosine kinase that is the receptor for mast cell growth factor. Because mutated KIT can transform cells, we examined c-KIT in skin lesions of 22 patients with sporadic mastocytosis and 3 patients with familial mastocytosis. All patients with adult sporadic mastocytosis had somatic c-KIT mutations in codon 816 causing substitution of valine for aspartate and spontaneous activation of mast cell growth factor receptor (P = 0.0001). A subset of four pediatric onset cases with clinically unusual disease also had codon 816 activating mutations substituting valine, tyrosine, or phenylalanine for aspartate. Typical pediatric patients lacked 816 mutations, but limited sequencing showed three of six had a novel dominant inactivating mutation substituting lysine for glutamic acid in position 839, the site of a potential salt bridge that is highly conserved in receptor tyrosine kinases. No c-KIT mutations were found in the entire coding region of three patients with familial mastocytosis. We conclude that c-KIT somatic mutations substituting valine in position 816 of KIT are characteristic of sporadic adult mastocytosis and may cause this disease. Similar mutations causing activation of the mast cell growth factor receptor are found in children apparently at risk for extensive or persistent disease. In contrast, typical pediatric mastocytosis patients lack these mutations and may express inactivating c-KIT mutations. Familial mastocytosis, however, may occur in the absence of c-KIT coding mutations.","9990072","IVD","9990072","1"
"Immunogenicity and in vitro protective efficacy of a recombinant multistage Plasmodium falciparum candidate vaccine.","1999","Compared with a single-stage antigen-based vaccine, a multistage and multivalent Plasmodium falciparum vaccine would be more efficacious by inducing ""multiple layers"" of immunity. We have constructed a synthetic gene that encodes for 12 B cell, 6 T cell proliferative, and 3 cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes derived from 9 stage-specific P. falciparum antigens corresponding to the sporozoite, liver, erythrocytic asexual, and sexual stages. The gene was expressed in the baculovirus system, and a 41-kDa antigen, termed CDC/NIIMALVAC-1, was purified. Immunization in rabbits with the purified protein in the presence of different adjuvants generated antibody responses that recognized vaccine antigen, linear peptides contained in the vaccine, and all stages of P. falciparum. In vitro assays of protection revealed that the vaccine-elicited antibodies strongly inhibited sporozoite invasion of hepatoma cells and growth of blood-stage parasites in the presence of monocytes. These observations demonstrate that a multicomponent, multistage malaria vaccine can induce immune responses that inhibit parasite development at multiple stages. The rationale and approach used in the development of a multicomponent P. falciparum vaccine will be useful in the development of a multispecies human malaria vaccine and vaccines against other infectious diseases.","9990073","IVD","9990072","2"
